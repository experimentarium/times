# Introduction

This Appendix contains the updated (November 2010) documentation on the Climate Module option for the TIMES model. It provides is a streamlined version of the older version, and contains 5 sections: section {numref}`%s <a-mathematical-formulation>` contains a detailed description of the theoretical approach taken, section {numref}`%s <a-switches-and-parameters>` describes the parameters of the climate module, section {numref}`%s <a-variables>` the variables and section {numref}`%s <a-equations>` the equations. This version of the documentation does not include the complete formulations for all of the Climate equations (in GAMS form), and neither does it include the full GAMS specifications. However, it should be sufficient to gain a complete understanding of the equations in mathematical form, and should enable the user to define the parameters of the climate module.
