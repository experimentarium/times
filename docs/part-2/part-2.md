**General Introduction** **to the TIMES Documentation**

This documentation is composed of five Parts.

> **[Part I]{.underline}** provides a general description of the TIMES
> paradigm, with emphasis on the model's general structure and its
> economic significance. Part I also includes a simplified mathematical
> formulation of TIMES, a chapter comparing it to the MARKAL model,
> pointing to similarities and differences, and chapters describing new
> model options.
>
> **[Part II]{.underline}** constitutes a comprehensive reference manual
> intended for the technically minded modeler or programmer looking for
> an in-depth understanding of the complete model details, in particular
> the relationship between the input data and the model mathematics, or
> contemplating making changes to the model's equations. Part II
> includes a full description of the sets, attributes, variables, and
> equations of the TIMES model.
>
> **[Part III]{.underline}** describes the organization of the TIMES
> modeling environment and the GAMS control statements required to run
> the TIMES model. GAMS is a modeling language that translates a TIMES
> database into the Linear Programming matrix, and then submits this LP
> to an optimizer and generates the result files. Part III describes how
> the routines comprising the TIMES source code guide the model through
> compilation, execution, solve, and reporting; the files produced by
> the run process and their use; and the various switches that control
> the execution of the TIMES code according to the model instance,
> formulation options, and run options selected by the user. It also
> includes a section on identifying and resolving errors that may occur
> during the run process.
>
> **[Part IV]{.underline}** provides a step-by-step introduction to
> building a TIMES model in the VEDA2.0 user interface for model
> management and results analysis. It first offers an orientation to the
> basic features of VEDA2.0, including software layout, data files and
> tables, and model management features, both for handling the input and
> examining the results. It then describes in detail twelve Demo models
> (available for download from the ETSAP website) that progressively
> introduce VEDA-TIMES principles and modeling techniques.

# Introduction

The purpose of the Reference Manual is to lay out the full details of
the TIMES model, including data specification, internal data structures,
and mathematical formulation of the model's Linear Program (LP)
formulation, as well as the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations
required by some of its options. As such, it provides the TIMES
modeller/programmer with sufficiently detailed information to fully
understand the nature and purpose of the data components, model
equations and variables. A solid understanding of the material in this
Manual is a necessary prerequisite for anyone considering making
programming changes in the TIMES source code.

The Reference Manual is organized as follows:

Chapter 1 Basic notation and conventions: lays the groundwork for
understanding the rest of the material in the Reference Manual;

Chapter 2 Sets: explains the meaning and role of various sets that
identify how the model components are grouped according to their nature
(e.g. demand devices, power plants, energy carriers, etc.) in a TIMES
model;

Chapter 3 Parameters: elaborates the details related to the
user-provided numerical data, as well as the internally constructed data
structures, used by the model generator (and report writer) to derive
the coefficients of the LP matrix (and prepare the results for
analysis);

Chapter 4 Usage notes on special types of processes: Gives additional
information about using input sets and parameters for the modelling of
special types of processes: CHP, inter-regional exchange, and storage
processes;

Chapter 5 Variables: defines each variable that may appear in the
matrix, both explaining its nature and indicating how it fits into the
matrix structure;

Chapter 6 Equations: states each equation in the model, both explaining
its role and providing its explicit mathematical formulation. Includes
user constraints that may be employed by modellers to formulate
additional linear constraints, which are not part of the generic
constraint set of TIMES.

## Basic notation and conventions

To assist the reader, the following conventions are employed
consistently throughout this chapter:

-   Sets, and their associated index names, are in lower and bold case,
    e.g., **com** is the set of all commodities;

-   Literals, explicitly defined in the code, are in upper case within
    single quotes (note that in conformity with the GAMS syntax, single
    quotes must, in fact, be apostrophes), e.g., \'UP\' for upper bound;

-   Parameters, and scalars (constants, i.e., un-indexed parameters) are
    in upper case, e.g., NCAP_AF for the availability factor of a
    technology;

-   Variables are in upper case with a prefix of VAR\_, e.g., VAR_ACT
    corresponds to the activity level of a technology.

-   Equations are in upper case with a prefix of EQ\_ or EQ(l)\_ with
    the placeholder (l) denoting the equation type (l=E for a strict
    equality, l=L for an inequality with the left hand side term being
    smaller than or equal to the right hand side term and l=G for an
    inequality with the left hand side term being greater than or equal
    to the right hand side term), e.g., EQ_PTRANS is the process
    transformation equation (strict equality), and EQG_COMBAL is the
    commodity balance constraint of type G (inequality).

## GAMS modelling language and TIMES implementation

TIMES consists of generic variables and equations constructed from the
specification of sets and parameter values depicting an energy system
for each distinct region in a model. To construct a TIMES model, a
preprocessor first translates all data defined by the modeller into
special internal data structures representing the coefficients of the
TIMES matrix applied to each variable of Chapter 5 for each equation of
Chapter 6 in which the variable may appear. This step is called Matrix
Generation. Once the model is solved (optimised) a Report Writer
assembles the results of the run for analysis by the modeller. The
matrix generation, report writer, and control files are written in
GAMS[^1] (the General Algebraic Modelling System), a powerful high-level
language specifically designed to facilitate the process of building
large-scale optimisation models. GAMS accomplishes this by relying
heavily on the concepts of sets, compound indexed parameters, dynamic
looping and conditional controls, variables and equations. Thus there is
very a strong synergy between the philosophy of GAMS and the overall
concept of the RES specification embodied in TIMES, making GAMS very
well suited to the TIMES paradigm.

Furthermore, by nature of its underlying design philosophy, the GAMS
code is very similar to the mathematical description of the equations
provided in Chapter 6. Thus, the approach taken to implement a TIMES
model is to "massage" the input data by means of a (rather complex)
preprocessor that handles the necessary exceptions that need to be taken
into consideration to properly construct the matrix coefficients in a
form ready to be applied to the appropriate variables in the respective
equations. GAMS also integrates seamlessly with a wide range of
commercially available optimisers that are charged with the task of
solving the actual TIMES linear (LP) or mixed integer (MIP) problems
that represent the desired model. This step is called the Solve or
Optimisation step. CPLEX or XPRESS are the optimisers most often
employed to solve the TIMES LP and MIP formulations.

The standard TIMES formulation has optional features, such as lumpy
investments and endogenous technology learning. The organization and
layout of the TIMES code, along with how it is processed by GAMS during
a model run, is discussed in detail in PART III. In addition, a modeller
experienced in GAMS programming and the details of the TIMES
implementation could define additional equation modules or report
routine modules based on this organization, which allows the linkage of
these modules to the standard TIMES code in a flexible way. However, any
thoughts of modifying the core TIMES code should be discussed and
coordinated with ETSAP.

To build, run, and analyse a TIMES model, several software tools have
been developed in the past or are currently under development, so that
the modeller does not need to provide the input information needed to
build a TIMES model directly in GAMS. These tools are the model
interfaces VEDA-FE and ANSWER-TIMES, as well as the reporting and
analysing tool VEDA-BE.

# Sets

Sets are used in TIMES to group elements or combinations of elements
with the purpose of specifying qualitative characteristics of the energy
system. One can distinguish between one-dimensional and
multi-dimensional sets. The former sets contain single elements, e.g.
the set **prc** contains all processes of the model, while the elements
of multi-dimensional sets are a combination of one-dimensional sets. An
example for a multi-dimensional set is the set **top**, which specifies
for a process the commodities entering and leaving that process.

Two types of sets are employed in the TIMES framework: user input sets
and internal sets. User input sets are created by the user, and used to
describe qualitative information and characteristics of the depicted
energy system. One can distinguish the following functions associated
with user input sets:

-   definition of the elements or building blocks of the energy system
    model (i.e. regions, processes, commodities),

-   definition of the time horizon and the sub-annual time resolution,

-   definition of special characteristics of the elements of the energy
    system.

In addition to these user sets, TIMES also generates its own internal
sets. Internal sets serve to both ensure proper exception handling
(e.g., from what date is a technology available, or in which time-slices
is a technology permitted to operate), as well as sometimes just to
improve the performance or smooth the complexity of the actual model
code.

In the following sections, the user input sets and the internal sets
will be presented. A special type of set is a one-dimensional set, also
called index, which is needed to build multi-dimensional sets or
parameters. At the highest level of the one-dimensional sets are the
master or "domain" sets that define the comprehensive list of elements
(e.g., the main building blocks of the reference energy system such as
the processes and commodities in all regions) permitted at all other
levels, with which GAMS performs complete domain checking, helping to
automatically ensure the correctness of set definition (for instance, if
the process name used in a parameter is not spelled correctly, GAMS will
issue a warning). Therefore, before elaborating on the various sets, the
indexes used in TIMES are discussed.

## Indexes (One-dimensional sets)

Indexes (also called one-dimensional sets) contain in most cases the
different elements of the energy model. A list of all indexes used in
TIMES is given in Table 2. Examples of indexes are the set **prc**
containing all processes, the set **c** containing all commodities, or
the set **all_reg** containing all regions of the model. Some of the
one-dimensional sets are subsets of another one-dimensional set, e.g.,
the set **r** comprising the so-called internal model regions is a
subset of the set **all_reg,** which in addition also contains the
so-called external model regions[^2]. To express that the set **r**
depends on the set **all_reg**, the master set **all_reg** is put in
brackets after the set name **r**: **r**(**all_reg**).

The set **cg** comprises all commodity groups[^3]. Each commodity c is
considered as a commodity group with only one element: the commodity
itself. Thus the commodity set **c** is a subset of the commodity group
set **cg**.

Apart from indexes that are under user control, some indexes have fixed
elements to serve as indicators within sets and parameters, most of
which should not be modified by the user (Table 1). Exceptions to this
rule are the sets defined in the file MAPLISTS.DEF. For example, while
the process groups (**prc_grp)** listed in Table 1 are used within the
code and must not be deleted, other process groups may be added by the
user.

: Table 2: Indexes in TIMES

##  User input sets

The user input sets contain the fundamental information regarding the
structure and the characteristics of the underlying energy system model.
The user input sets can be grouped according to the type of information
related to them:

-   One dimensional sets defining the components of the energy system:
    regions, commodities, processes;

-   Sets defining the Reference Energy System (RES) within each region;

-   Sets defining the inter-connections (trade) between regions;

-   Sets defining the time structure of the model: periods, timeslices,
    timeslice hierarchy;

-   Sets defining various properties of processes or commodities.

The formulation of user constraints also uses sets to specify the type
and the features of a constraint. The structure and the input
information required to construct a user constraint is covered in detail
in Chapter 6, and therefore will not be presented here.

Most of the set specifications are handled for the user by the user
shell through process and commodity characterization, and the user does
not need to input these sets directly.

In the following subsections first the sets related to the definition of
the RES will be described (subsection 2.2.1), then the sets related to
the time horizon and the sub-annual representation of the energy system
will be presented (subsection 2.2.2). The mechanism for defining trade
between regions of a multi-regional model is discussed in subsection
2.2.3. Finally, an overview of all possible user input sets is given in
subsection 2.2.4.

### Definition of the Reference Energy System (RES)

A TIMES model is structured by regions (**all_r**). One can distinguish
between external regions and internal regions. The internal regions
(**r**) correspond to regions within the area of study, and for which a
RES has been defined by the user. Each internal region may contain
processes and commodities to depict an energy system, whereas external
regions serve only as origins of commodities (e.g. for import of primary
energy resources or for the import of energy carriers) or as destination
for the export of commodities. A region is defined as an internal region
by putting it in the internal region set (**r)**, which is a subset of
the set of all regions **all_r**. An external region needs no explicit
definition, all regions that are member of the set **all_r** but not
member of **r** are external regions. A TIMES model must consist of at
least one internal region, the number of external regions is arbitrary.
The main building blocks of the RES are processes (**p**) and
commodities (**c)**, which are connected by commodity flows to form a
network. An example of a RES with one internal region (UTOPIA) and two
external regions (IMPEXP, MINRNW) is given in Figure 1.

All components of the energy system, as well as nearly the entire input
information, are identified by a region index. It is therefore possible
to use the same process name in different regions with different
numerical data (and description if desired), or even completely
different commodities associated with the process.

![](media/image1.emf)

Figure 1: Example of internal and external regions in TIMES

#### Processes

A process may represent an individual plant, e.g. a specific existing
nuclear power plant, or a generic technology, e.g. the coal-fired IGCC
technology. TIMES distinguishes three main types of processes:

-   Standard processes;

-   Inter-regional exchange processes, and

-   Storage processes.

##### Standard processes

The so-called standard processes can be used to model the majority of
the energy technologies, e.g., condensing power plants, heat plants, CHP
plants, demand devices such as boilers, coal extraction processes, etc.
Standard processes can be classified into the following groups:

-   PRE for generic energy processes;

-   PRW for material processing technologies (by weight);

-   PRV for material processing technologies (by volume);

-   REF for refinery processes;

-   ELE for electricity generation technologies;

-   HPL for heat generation technologies;

-   CHP for combined heat and power plants;

-   DMD for demand devices;

-   DISTR for distribution systems;

-   MISC for miscellaneous processes.

The process classification is done via the set **prc_map(r,prc_grp,p)**.
This grouping is mainly intended for reporting purposes, but in some
cases it also affects the properties of the processes[^10] and the
constraint matrix. The set is maintained in the MAPLIST.DEF file, and
may be adjusted by user with additional technology groups of interest,
with some restrictions as noted in Table 1.

The topology of a standard process is specified by the set
**top(r,p,c,io)** of all quadruples such that the process **p** in
region **r** is consuming (**io** = \'IN\') or producing (**io** =
\'OUT\') commodity **c**. Usually, for each entry of the topology set
**top** a flow variable (see **VAR_FLO** in Chapter 5) will be created.
When the so-called *reduction algorithm* is activated, some flow
variables may be eliminated and replaced by other variables (see PART
III, Section 3.7 for details).

The activity variable (**VAR_ACT**) of a standard process is in most
cases equal to the sum of one or several commodity flows on either the
input or the output side of a process. The activity of a process is
limited by the available capacity, so that the activity variable
establishes a link between the installed capacity of a process and the
maximum possible commodity flows entering or leaving the process during
a year or a subdivision of a year. The commodity flows that define the
process activity are specified by the set **prc_actunt(r,p,cg,u)** where
the commodity index **cg** may be a single commodity or a user-defined
commodity group, and **u** is the activity unit. The commodity group
defining the activity of a process is also called **P**rimary
**C**ommodity **G**roup (PCG).

![](media/image2.emf)

Figure 2: Example of the definition of a commodity group and the
activity of a normal process.

User-defined commodity groups are specified by means of the set
**com_gmap(r,cg,c)**, which indicates the commodities (c) belonging to
the group (cg). Once a user-defined commodity group has been defined,
one can use it for any processes for defining attributes that require a
commodity group (not only for the definition of the process activity,
but also for other purposes, e.g., in the transformation equation
EQ_PTRANS), as long as the members of the group are valid for the
particular process and the process characteristic to be defined.

An example for the definition of the activity of a process is shown in
Figure 2. In order to define the activity of the process SRE as the sum
of the two output flows of gasoline (GSL) and diesel (DSL), one has to
define a commodity group called CG_SRE containing these two commodities.
The name of the commodity group can be arbitrarily chosen by the
modeller.

In addition to the activity of a process, one has to define the capacity
unit of the process. This is done by means of the set
**prc_capunt(r,p,cg,u)**, where the index **cg** denotes the primary
commodity group. In the example in Figure 3 the capacity of the refinery
process is defined in mtoe/a (megatonne oil equivalent). Since the
capacity and activity units are different (mtoe for the capacity and PJ
for the activity), the user has to supply the conversion factor from the
energy unit embedded in the capacity unit to the activity unit. This is
done by specifying the parameter **prc_capact(r,p)**. In the example
**prc_capact** has the value 41.868.

![](media/image3.emf)

Figure 3: Example of the definition of the capacity unit

It might occur that the unit in which the commodity(ies) of the primary
commodity group are measured, is different from the activity unit. An
example is shown in Figure 4. The activity of the transport technology
CAR is defined by commodity TX1, which is measured in passenger
kilometres PKM. The activity of the process is, however, defined in
vehicle kilometres VKM, while the capacity of the process CAR is defined
as number of cars NOC.

![](media/image4.emf)

Figure 4: Example of different activity and commodity units

The conversion factor from capacity to activity unit **prc_capact**
describes the average mileage of a car per year. The process parameter
**prc_actflo(r,y,p,cg)** contains the conversion factor from the
activity unit to the commodity unit of the primary commodity group. In
the example this factor corresponds to the average number of persons per
car (1.5).

##### Inter-regional exchange processes

Inter-regional exchange (IRE) processes are used for trading commodities
between regions. They are needed for linking internal regions with
external regions as well as for modelling trade between internal
regions. A process is specified as an inter-regional exchange process by
specifying it as a member of the set **prc_map(r,**\'**IRE**\'**,p)**.
If the exchange process is connecting internal regions, this set entry
is required for each of the internal regions trading with region r. The
topology of an inter-regional exchange process **p** is defined by the
set **top_ire(all_reg,com,all_r,c,p)** stating that the commodity
**com** in region **all_reg** is exported to the region **all_r** (the
traded commodity may have a different name **c** in region **all_r**
than in region **all_reg)**. For example the topology of the export of
the commodity electricity (ELC_F) from France (FRA) to Germany (GER),
where the commodity is called ELC_G via the exchange process (HV_GRID)
is modelled by the **top_ire** entry:

**top_ire**(\'FRA\', \'ELC_F\', \'GER\', \'ELC_G\', \'HV_GRID\')

The first pair of region and commodity (\'FRA\', \'ELC_F\') denotes the
origin and the name of the traded commodity, while the second pair
(\'GER\', \'ELC_G\') denotes the destination. The name of the traded
commodity can be different in both regions, here \'ELC_F\' in France and
\'ELC_G\' in Germany, depending on the chosen commodity names in both
regions. As with standard processes, the activity definition set
**prc_actunt(r,p,cg,u)** has to be specified for an exchange process
belonging to each internal region. The special features related to
inter-regional exchange processes are described in subsection .

##### Storage processes

Storage processes are used to store a commodity either between periods
or between timeslices. A process (**p**) can be specified to be an
inter-period storage (IPS) process for commodity (**c**) by defining the
process to be of the type \'**STK**\' and **c** as its PCG (or,
alternatively, including it as a member of the set
**prc_stgips(r,p,c)**). In a similar way, a process is characterised as
a timeslice storage by defining the process to be of the type
\'**STG**\' and **c** as its PCG (alternatively, by inclusion in the set
**prc_stgtss(r,p,c)**). A special case of timeslice storage is a
so-called night-storage device (NST) where the commodity for charging
and the one for discharging the storage are different. An example for a
night storage device is an electric heating technology which is charged
during the night using electricity and produces heat during the day.
Including a process in the set **prc_nstts(r,p,s)** indicates that it is
a night storage device which is charged in timeslice(s) **s**. More than
one timeslice can be specified as charging timeslices, the non-specified
timeslices are assumed to be discharging timeslices. The charging and
discharging commodity of a night storage device are specified by the
topology set (**top).** It should be noted that for inter-period storage
and normal timeslice storage processes (non-NST) the commodity entering
and leaving the storage (the charged and discharged commodity) should be
a member of the PCG (and both should be, if they are different). Other
auxiliary commodity flows are also permitted in combination with these
two storage types, by including them in the topology (see Section
4.3.5).

As for standard processes, the flows that define the activity of a
storage process are identified by providing the set
**prc_actunt(r,p,c)** entry. In contrast to standard processes, the
activity of a storage process is however interpreted as the amount of
the commodity being stored in the storage process. Accordingly the
capacity of a storage process describes the maximum commodity amount
that can be kept in storage.

Internally, a **prc_map(r,\'STG\',p)** entry is always generated for all
storage processes to put the process in the group of storage processes.
A further **prc_map** entry is created to specify the type of storage
(\'STK\' for inter-period storage, \'STS\' for general time-slice
storage and \'NST\' for a night-storage device), unless already defined
so by the user.

#### Commodities

As mentioned before, the set of commodities ( **c** ) is a subset of the
commodity group set (**cg)**. A commodity in TIMES is characterised by
its type, which may be an energy carrier (\'NRG\'), a material
(\'MAT\'), an emission or environmental impact (\'ENV\'), a demand
commodity (\'DEM\') or a financial resource (\'FIN\'). The commodity
type is indicated by membership in the commodity type mapping set
(**com_tmap(r,com_type,c)**)**.** The commodity type affects the default
sense of the commodity balance equation. For NRG, ENV and DEM the
commodity production is normally greater than or equal to consumption,
while for MAT and FIN the default commodity balance constraint is
generated as an equality. The type of the commodity balance can be
modified by the user for individual commodities by means of the
commodity limit set (**com_lim(r,c,lim)**). The unit in which a
commodity is measured is indicated by the commodity unit set
(**com_unit(r,c,units_com)**). The user should note that within the GAMS
code of TIMES no unit conversion, e.g., of import prices, takes place
when the commodity unit is changed from one unit to another one.
Therefore, the proper handling of the units is entirely the
responsibility of the user (or the user interface).

### Definition of the time structure

#### Time horizon

The time horizon for which the energy system is analysed may range from
one year to many decades. The time horizon is usually split into several
*periods* which are represented by so-called *milestone years*
(**t(allyear)** or **milestonyr(allyear)**, see Figure 5). Each
milestone year represents a point in time where decisions may be taken
by the model, e.g. installation of new capacity or changes in the energy
flows. The activity and flow variables used in TIMES may therefore be
considered as average values over a period. The shortest possible
duration of a period is one year. However, in order to keep the number
of variables and equations at a manageable size, periods are usually
comprised of several years. The durations of the periods do not have to
be equal, so that it is possible that the first period, which usually
represents the past and is used to calibrate the model to historic data,
has a length of one year, while the following periods may have longer
durations. Thus in TIMES both the number of periods and the duration of
each period are fully under user control. The beginning year of a period
**t**, **B(t)**, and its ending year, **E(t)**, have to be specified as
input parameters by the user (see Table 13 in subsection 3.1.3).

To describe capacity installations that took place before the beginning
of the model horizon, and still exist during the modeling horizon, TIMES
uses additional years, the so-called *past years*
(**pastyear(allyear)**), which identify the construction completion year
of the already existing technologies. The amount of capacity that has
been installed in a pastyear is specified by the parameter
**NCAP_PASTI(r,allyear,p)**, also called *past investment*. For a
process, an arbitrary number of past investments may be specified to
reflect the age structure in the existing capacity stock. The union of
the sets **milestonyr** and **pastyear** is called **modelyear** (or
**v**). The years for which input data is provided by the user are
called datayears (**datayear(allyear)**). The datayears do not have to
coincide with modelyears, since the preprocessor will interpolate or
extrapolate the data internally to the modelyears. All pastyears are by
default included in datayears, but, as a general rule, any other years
for which input data is provided should be explicitly included in the
set **datayear** or that information will not be seen by the model.
Apart from a few exceptions (see Table 3), all parameter values defined
for years other than datayears (or pastyears) are ignored by the model
generator. Due to the distinction between of modelyears and datayears,
the definition of the model horizon, e.g., the duration and number of
the periods, may be changed without having to adjust the input data to
the new periods. The rules and options of the inter- and extrapolation
routine are described in more detail in subection 3.1.1.

One should note that it is possible to define past investments
(**NCAP_PASTI**) not only for pastyears but also for any years within
the model horizon, including the milestone years. Since the first
period(s) of a model may cover historical data, it is useful to store
the already known capacity installations made during this time-span as
past investments and not as a bound on new investments in the model
database. If one later changes the beginning of the model horizon to a
more recent year, the capacity data of the first period(s) do not have
to be changed, since they are already stored as past investments. This
feature therefore supports the decoupling of the datayears, for which
input information is provided, and the definition of the model horizon
for which the model is run, making it relatively easy to change the
definition of the modeling horizon. Defining past investments for years
within the actual model horizon may also be useful for identifying
already planned (although not yet constructed) capacity expansions in
the near future[^11].

#### Timeslices

The **milestone** years can be further divided in sub-annual timeslices
in order to describe for the changing electricity load within a year,
which may affect the required electricity generation capacity, or other
commodity flows that need to be tracked at a finer than annual
resolution. Timeslices may be organised into four hierarchy levels only:
\'ANNUAL\', \'SEASON\', \'WEEKLY\' and \'DAYNITE\' defined by the
internal set **tslvl**. The level ANNUAL consists of only one member,
the predefined timeslice \'ANNUAL\', while the other levels may include
an arbitrary number of divisions. The desired timeslice levels are
activated by the user providing entries in set **ts_group(r,tslvl,s)**,
where also the individual user-provided timeslices (**s)** are assigned
to each level. An additional user input set **ts_map(r,s1,s2)** is
needed to determine the structure of a timeslice tree, where timeslice
**s1** is defined as the parent node of **s2**. Figure 6 illustrates a
timeslice tree, in which a year is divided into four seasons consisting
of working days and weekends, and each day is further divided into day
and night timeslices. The name of each timeslice has to be unique in
order to be used later as an index in other sets and parameters. Not all
timeslice levels have to be utilized when building a timeslice tree, for
example one can skip the \'WEEKLY\' level and directly connect the
seasonal timeslices with the daynite timeslices. The duration of each
timeslice is expressed as a fraction of the year by the parameter
G_YRFR(r,s). The user is responsible for ensuring that each lower level
group sums up properly to its parent timeslice, as this is not verified
by the pre-processor.

The definition of a timeslice tree is region-specific.[^13] When
different timeslice names and durations are used in two regions
connected by exchange processes, the mapping parameters
IRE_CCVT(r,c,reg,com) for commodities and IRE_TSCVT(r,s,reg,ts) for
timeslices have to be provided by the user to map the different
timeslice definitions. When the same timeslice definitions are used,
these mapping tables do not need to be specified by the user.

The original design of TIMES assumes that within each region, the
definition of the timeslice tree applies to all model periods, such that
one cannot employ different subsets of timeslices in different periods.
In fact, allowing dynamically changing timeslice trees would tend to
make both the model pre-processing and equation formulations
substantially more complex, and therefore this design decision may be
considered well justified. However, an experimental \"light-weight\"
implementation has been made in view of supporting also dynamic
timeslice trees (see Appendix E).

![](media/image6.wmf)

Figure 6: Example of a timeslice tree

Commodities may be tracked and process operation controlled at a
particular timeslice level by using the sets **com_tsl(r,c,tslvl)** and
**prc_tsl(r,p,tslvl)** respectively. Providing a commodity timeslice
level determines for which timeslices the commodity balance will be
generated, where the default is \'ANNUAL\'. For processes, the set
**prc_tsl** determines the timeslice level of the activity variable.
Thus, for instance, condensing power plants may be forced to operate on
a seasonal level, so that the activity during a season is uniform, while
hydropower production may vary between days and nights, if the
\'DAYNITE\' level is specified for hydro power plants. Instead of
specifying a timeslice level, the user can also identify individual
timeslices for which a commodity or a process is available by the sets
**com_ts(r,c,s)** and **prc_ts(r,p,s)** respectively. Note that when
specifying individual timeslices for a specific commodity or process by
means of **com_ts** or **prc_ts** they all have to be on the same
timeslice level.

The timeslice level of the commodity flows entering and leaving a
process are determined internally by the preprocessor. The timeslice
level of a flow variable equals the timeslice level of the process when
the flow variable is part of the primary commodity group (PCG) defining
the activity of the process. Otherwise the timeslice level of a flow
variable is set to whichever level is finer, that of the commodity or
the process.

### Multi-regional models

If a TIMES model consists of several internal regions, it is called a
multi-regional model. Each of the internal regions contains a unique RES
to represent the particularities of the region. As already mentioned,
the regions can be connected by inter-regional exchange processes to
enable trade of commodities between the regions. Two types of trade
activities can be depicted in TIMES: bi-lateral trade between two
regions and multilateral trade between several supply and demand
regions.

Bi-lateral trade takes place between specific pairs of regions. A pair
of regions together with an exchange process and the direction of the
commodity flow are first identified, where the model ensures that trade
through the exchange process is balanced between these two regions
(whatever amount is exported from region A to region B must be imported
by region B from region A, possibly adjusted for trans­portation losses).
The basic structure is shown in Figure 7. Bi-lateral trading may be
fully described in TIMES by defining an inter-regional exchange process
and by specifying the two pair-wise connections by indicating the
regions and commodities be traded via the set
**top_ire(r,c,reg,com,p)**. If trade should occur only in one direction
then only that direction is provided in the set **top_ire** (export from
region r into region reg). The process capacity and the process related
costs (e.g. activity costs, investment costs) of the exchange process
can be described individually for both regions by specifying the
corresponding parameters in each regions. If for example the investment
costs for an electricity line between two regions A and B are 1000
monetary units (MU) per MW and 60 % of these investment costs should be
allocated to region A and the remaining 40 % to region B, the investment
costs for the exchange process have to be set to 600 MU/MW in region A
and to 400 MU/MW in region B.

![](media/image7.wmf)

Figure 7: Bilateral trade in TIMES

Bi-lateral trade is the most detailed way to specify trade between
regions. However, there are cases when it is not important to fully
specify the pair of trading regions. In such cases, the so-called
*multi-lateral trade* option decreases the size of the model while
preserving enough flexibility. Multi-lateral trade is based on the idea
that a common marketplace exists for a traded commodity with several
supplying and several consuming regions for the commodity, e.g. for
crude oil or GHG emission permits. To facilitate the modelling of this
kind of trade scheme the concept of marketplace has been introduced in
TIMES. To model a marketplace first the user has to identify one
internal region that participates both in the production and consumption
of the traded commodity. Then only one exchange process is used to link
the supply and demand regions with the marketplace region using the set
**top_ire**.[^14]

The following example illustrates the modelling of a marketplace in
TIMES. Assume that we want to set up a market-based trading where the
commodity CRUD can be exported by regions A, B, C, and D, and that it
can be imported by regions C, D, E and F (Figure 8).

![](media/image8.wmf)

Figure 8: Example of multi-lateral trade in TIMES

First, the exchange process and marketplace should be defined. For
example, we could choose the region C as the marketplace region. The
exchange process has the name XP. The trade possibilities can then be
defined simply by the following six **top_ire** entries:

> SET PRC / XP /;
>
> SET TOP_IRE /
>
> A .CRUD .C .CRUD .XP
>
> B .CRUD .C .CRUD .XP
>
> D .CRUD .C .CRUD .XP
>
> C .CRUD .D .CRUD .XP
>
> C .CRUD .E .CRUD .XP
>
> C .CRUD .F .CRUD .XP
>
> /;

To complete the RES definition of the exchange process, only the set
**prc_actunt(r,p,c,u)** is needed to define the units for the exchange
process XP in all regions:

> SET PRC_ACTUNT /
>
> A .XP .CRUD .PJ
>
> B .XP .CRUD .PJ
>
> C .XP .CRUD .PJ
>
> D .XP .CRUD .PJ
>
> E .XP .CRUD .PJ
>
> F .XP .CRUD .PJ
>
> /;

These definitions are sufficient for setting up of the market-based
trade. Additionally, the user can of course specify various other data
for the exchange processes, for example investment and distribution
costs, and efficiencies.

### Overview of all user input sets

All the input sets which are under user control in TIMES are listed in
Table 4. For a few sets default settings exist that are applied if no
user input information is given. Set names starting with the prefix
'com\_' are associated with commodities, the prefix 'prc\_' denotes
process information and the prefix 'uc\_' is reserved for sets related
to user constraints. Column 3 of Table 4 is a description of each set.
In some cases (especially for complex sets), two (equivalent)
descriptions may be given, the first in general terms, followed by a
more precise description within square brackets, given in terms of
n-tuples of indices.

**Remark**

Sets are used in basically two ways:

-   as the domain over which summations must be effected in some
    mathematical expression, or

-   as the domain over which a particular expression or constraint must
    be enumerated (replicated).

In the case of n-dimensional sets, some indexes may be used for
**enumeration and others for summation**. In each such situation, the
distinction between the two uses of the indexes is made clear by the way
each index is used in the expression.

An example will illustrate this important point: consider the
4-dimensional set **top,** having indexes r,p,c,io (see table 4 for its
precise description). If some quantity **A(r,p,c,io)** must be
enumerated for all values of the third index (c=commodity) and of the
last index (io=orientation), but summed over all processes (p) and
regions (r), this will be mathematically denoted:

![](media/image9.wmf)

It is thus understood from the indexes listed in the name of the
expression (c,io), that these two indexes are being enumerated, and
thus, by deduction, only r and p are being summed upon. Thus the
expression calculates the total of A for each commodity c, in each
direction io ('IN' and 'OUT'), summed over all processes and regions.

Another example illustrates the case of nested summations, where index r
is enumerated in the inner summation, but is summed upon in the outer
summation. Again here, the expression is made unambiguous by observing
the positions of the different indexes (for instance, the outer
summation is done on the r index)

##  Definition of internal sets

The sets internally derived by the TIMES model generator are given in
Table 5. The list of internal sets presented here concentrates on the
ones frequently used in the model generator and the ones used in the
description of the model equations in Chapter 6. Some internal sets are
omitted from Table 5 as they are strictly auxiliary sets of the
preprocessor whose main purpose is the reduction of the computation time
for preprocessor operations.

: Table 5: Internal sets in TIMES

#  Parameters

While sets describe structural information of the energy system or
qualitative characteristics of its entities (e.g. processes or
commodities), parameters contain numerical information. Examples of
parameters are the import price of an energy carrier or the investment
cost of a technology. Most parameters are time-series where a value is
provided (or interpolated) for each year (datayear). The TIMES model
generator distinguishes between user input parameters and internal
parameters. The former are provided by the modeller (usually by way of a
data handling system or "shell" such a VEDA-FE or ANSWER-TIMES), while
the latter are internally derived from the user input parameters, in
combination with information given by sets, in order to calculate for
example the cost coefficients in the objective function. This Chapter
first covers the user input parameters in Section 3.1 and then describes
the most important internal parameters as far as they are relevant for
the basic understanding of the equations (Section 3.2). Section 3.3
presents the parameters used for reporting the results of a model run.

## User input parameters

This section provides an overview of the user input parameters that are
available in TIMES to describe the energy system. Before presenting the
various parameters in detail in Section 3.1.3 two preprocessing
algorithms applied to the user input data are presented, namely the
inter-/extrapolation and the inheritance/aggregation routines. User
input parameters that are time-dependent can be provided by the user for
those years for which statistical information or future projections are
available, and the inter-/extrapolation routine described in Section
3.1.1 used to adjust the input data to the years required for the model
run. Timeslice dependent parameters do not have to be provided on the
timelice level of a process, commodity or commodity flow. Instead the
so-called inheritance/aggregation routine described in Section 3.1.2
assigns the input data from the user provided timeslice level to the
appropriate timeslice level as necessary.

### Inter- and extrapolation of user input parameters

Time-dependent user input parameters are specified for specific years,
the so-called *datayears* (**datayear**). These datayears do not have to
coincide with the modelyears (**v** or **modelyear)** needed for the
current run. Reasons for differences between these two sets are for
example that the period definition for the model has been altered after
having provided the initial set of input data leading to different
milestoneyears (**t** or **milestoneyr)** or that data are only
available for certain years that do not match the modelyears. In order
to avoid burdening the user with the cumbersome adjustment of the input
data to the modelyears, an inter-/extrapolation (I/E) routine is
embedded in the TIMES model generator. The inter-/extrapolation routine
distinguishes between a default inter-/extrapolation that is
automatically applied to the input data and an enhanced user-controlled
inter-/extrapolation that allows the user to specify an
inter-/extrapolation rule for each time-series explicitly. Independent
of the default or user-controlled I/E options, TIMES inter-/extrapolates
(using the standard algorithm) all cost parameters in the objective
function to the individual years of the model as part of calculating the
annual cost details (see section 3.1.1.3 below).

The possibility of controlling interpolation on a time-series basis
improves the independence between the years found in the primary
database and the data actually used in the individual runs of a TIMES
model. In this way the model is made more flexible with respect to
running scenarios with arbitrary model years and period lengths, while
using basically the very same input database.

#### Inter/extrapolation options

The TIMES interpolation/extrapolation facility provides both a default
I/E method for all time-series parameters, and options for the user to
control the interpolation and extrapolation of each individual time
series (Table 6). The option 0 does not change the default behavior. The
specific options that correspond to the default methods are 3 (the
standard default) and 10 (alternative default method for bounds and RHS
parameters).

Non-default interpolation/extrapolation can be requested for any
parameter by providing an additional instance of the parameter with an
indicator in the YEAR index and a value corresponding to one of the
integer-valued Option Codes (see Table 6 and example below). This
control specification activates the interpolation/extrapolation rule for
the time series, and is distinguished from actual time-series data by
providing a special control label (\'**0**\') in the YEAR index. The
particular interpolation rule to apply is a function of the Option Code
assigned to the control record for the parameter. Note that for
log-linear interpolation the Option Code indicates the year from which
the interpolation is switched from standard to log-linear mode. TIMES
user shell(s) will provide mechanisms for imbedding the control label
and setting the Option Code through easily understandable selections
from a user-friendly drop-down list, making the specification simple and
transparent to the user.

The enhanced interpolation/extrapolation facility provides the user with
the following options to control the interpolation and extrapolation of
each individual time series:

Migration means that data points are interpolated and extrapolated
within each period but not across periods. This method thus migrates any
data point specified for other than milestoneyr year to the
corresponding milestoneyr year within the period, so that it will be
effective in that period.

Log-linear interpolation means that the values in the data series are
interpreted as coefficients of annual change beyond a given YEAR. The
YEAR can be any year, including modelyears. The user only has to take
care that the data values in the data series correspond to the
interpretation given to them when using the log-linear option. For
simplicity, however, the first data point is always interpreted as an
absolute value, because log-linear interpolation requires at least one
absolute data point to start with.

#### Default inter/extrapolation

The standard default method of inter-/extrapolation corresponds to the
option 3, which interpolates linearly between data points, while it
extrapolates the first/last data point constantly backward/forward. This
method, full interpolation and extrapolation, is by default applied to
most TIMES time series parameters. However, the parameters listed in
Table 7 are by default **NOT** inter/extrapolated in this way, but have
a different default method.

#### Interpolation of cost parameters

As a general rule, all cost parameters in TIMES are densely interpolated
and extrapolated. This means that the parameters will have a value for
every single year within the range of years they apply, and the changes
in costs over years will thus be accurately taken into account in the
objective function. The user can use the interpolation options 1--5 for
even cost parameters. Whenever an option is specified for a cost
parameter, it will be first sparsely interpolated/extrapolated according
to the user option over the union of modelyear and datayear, and any
remaining empty data points are filled with the EPS value. The EPS
values will ensure that despite the subsequent dense interpolation the
effect of user option will be preserved to the extent possible. However,
one should note that due to dense interpolation, the effects of the user
options will inevitably be smoothed.

#### Examples of using I/E options

**Example 1:**

> Assume that we have three normal data points in a FLO_SHAR data
> series:
>
> FLO_SHAR(\'REG\',\'1995\',\'PRC1\',\'COAL\',\'IN_PRC1\',\'ANNUAL\',\'UP\')
> = 0.25;
>
> FLO_SHAR(\'REG\',\'2010\',\'PRC1\',\'COAL\',\'IN_PRC1\',\'ANNUAL\',\'UP\')
> = 0.12;
>
> FLO_SHAR(\'REG\',\'2020\',\'PRC1\',\'COAL\',\'IN_PRC1\',\'ANNUAL\',\'UP\')
> = 0.05;
>
> FLO_SHAR is by default NOT interpolated or extrapolated in TIMES. To
> force interpolation/extrapolation of the FLO_SHAR parameter the
> following control option for this data series should be added:
>
> FLO_SHAR(\'REG\',\'0\',\'PRC1\',\'COAL\',\'IN_PRC1\',\'ANNUAL\',\'UP\')
> = 3;

  : Table 8: Parameters which cannot be interpolated.

All the enhanced I/E options described above are available for all TIMES
time-series parameters, excluding PRC_RESID and COM_BPRICE. PRC_RESID is
always interpolated, as if option 1 were used, but is also extrapolated
forwards over TLIFE when either I/E option 5 or 15 is specified.
COM_BPRICE is not interpolated at all, as it is obtained from the
Baseline solution. Moreover, the I/E options are not applicable to the
integer-valued parameters related to the SHAPE and MULTI tables, which
are listed in Table 8.

Nonetheless, a few options are supported also for the extrapolation of
the MULTI and SHAPE index parameters, as shown in Table 9. The
extrapolation can be done either only inside the data points provided by
the user, or both inside and outside those data points. When using the
inside data points option, the index specified for any **datayear** is
extrapolated to all modelyears (**v)** between that **datayear** and the
following **datayear** for which the SHAPE index is specified. The
extrapolation options are available for all of the SHAPE and MULTI
parameters listed in Table 8.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Option code**   **Action**
  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  \<= 0 (or none)   No extrapolation (default)

  1                 Extrapolation between data points only

  2                 Extrapolation between and outside data points

  11                Extrapolation between data points only, migration at
                    ends

> NCAP_AFX(\'REG\', \'1995\', \'PRC1\') = 12;
>
> NCAP_AFX(\'REG\', \'2010\', \'PRC1\') = 13;
>
> In this case, all modelyears (**v)** between 1995 and 2010 will get
> the shape index 12. No extrapolation is done for modelyears (**v)**
> beyond 2010 or before 1995.

### Inheritance and aggregation of timesliced input parameters

As mentioned before, processes and commodities can be modelled in TIMES
on different timeslice levels. Some of the input parameters that
describe a process or a commodity are timeslice specific, i.e. they have
to be provided by the user for specific timeslices, e.g. the
availability factor NCAP_AF of a power plant operating on a \'DAYNITE\'
timeslice level. During the process of developing a model, the timeslice
resolution of some processes or even the entire model may be refined.
One could imagine for example the situation that a user starts
developing a model on an \'ANNUAL\' timeslice level and refines the
model later by refining the timeslice definition of the processes and
commodities. In order to avoid the need for all the timeslice related
parameters to be re-entered again for the finer timeslices, TIMES
supports inheritance and aggregation of parameter values along the
timeslice tree.

Inheritance in this context means that input data being specified on a
coarser timeslice level (higher up the tree) are inherited to a finer
timeslice level (lower down the tree), whereas aggregation means that
timeslice specific data are aggregated from a finer timeslice level
(lower down the tree) to a coarser one (further up the tree). The
inheritance feature may also be useful in some cases where the value of
a parameter should be the same over all timeslices, since in this case
it is sufficient to provide the parameter value for the \'ANNUAL\'
timeslice which is then inherited to the required finer target
timeslices.[^21]

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Inheritance       **Description**
  rules**             
  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  Direct inheritance  A value on a coarser timeslice is inherited by
                      target timeslices below (in the timeslice tree),
                      without changing the numeric values.

  Weighted            A value on a coarser timeslice is inherited by
  inheritance         target timeslices below (in the timeslice tree) by
                      weighting the input value with the ratio of the
                      duration of the target timeslices to the duration
                      of the coarser timeslice. Example: Parameter
                      COM_FR.

  No inheritance      Absolute bound parameters specified on a coarser
                      timeslice level than the target timeslice level are
                      not inherited. Instead a constraint summing over
                      related variables on the finer timeslices is
                      generated, e.g. an annual ACT_BND parameter
                      specified for a process with a \'DAYNITE\' process
                      timeslice level (prc_tsl) leads to a constraint
                      (EQ_ACTBND) with the summation over the activity
                      variables on the \'DAYNITE\' level as LHS term and
                      with the bound as RHS term.

  **Aggregation       **Description**
  rules**             

  Standard            The values specified on finer timeslices are
  aggregation         aggregated to the target timeslice being a parent
                      node in the timeslice tree by summing over the
                      values on the finer timeslices.

  Weighted            The values specified for finer timeslices are
  aggregation         aggregated to the target timeslice being a parent
                      node in the timeslice tree by summing over the
                      weighted values on the finer timeslices. The ratios
                      of the duration of the finer timeslices to the
                      duration of the target timeslice serve as weighting
                      factors.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table 10: Inheritance and aggregation rules

The TIMES pre-processor supports different inheritance and aggregation
rules, which depend on the type of attribute. The main characteristics
of the different inheritance and aggregation rules are summarised in .
The specific rules applied to each individual parameter are listed in
the detailed reference further below.

The different aggregation rules are illustrated by examples in Figure 9.
It should be noted that if input data are specified on two timeslice
levels different from the target level, then especially the weighted
inheritance/aggregation method may lead to incorrect results. Therefore,
at least for the parameters where weighted methods are applied, it is
recommended to provide input data only for timeslices on one timeslice
level. However, for parameters that are directly inherited, specifying
values at multiple levels may sometimes be a convenient way to reduce
the amount of values to be specified.[^22]

Bound parameters are in most cases not levelized by inheritance, only by
aggregation. Exceptions to this rule are the relative type bound
parameters NCAP_AF and FLO_SHAR, which are inherited by the target
timeslices. One should also notice that, due to levelization, fixed
bounds that are either inherited or aggregated to the target timeslice
level will always override any upper and lower bounds simultaneously
specified.

: Table 13: User input parameters in TIMES

##  Internal parameters

Table 14 gives an overview of internal parameters generated by the TIMES
preprocessor. Similar to the description of the internal sets, not all
internal parameters used within TIMES are discussed. The list given in
Table 14 focuses mainly on the parameters used in the preparation and
creation of the equations in Chapter 6. In addition to the internal
parameters listed here, the TIMES preprocessor computes additional
internal parameters which are either used only as auxiliary parameters
being valid only in a short section of the code or which are introduced
to improve the performance of the code regarding computational time.

##  Report parameters

### Overview of report parameters

The parameters generated internally by TIMES to document the results of
a model run are listed in Table 15. These parameters can be imported
into the **VEDA-BE** tool for further result analysis. They are
converted out of the **GDX**[^32] file via the **gdx2veda** GAMS utility
into a **VEDA-BE** compatible format according to the file
**times2veda.vdd**[^33]. Note that some of the results are not
transferred into parameters, but are directly accessed through the
**times2veda.vdd** file (levels of commodity balances and peaking
equation, total discounted value of objective function). The following
naming conventions apply to the prefixes of the report parameters:

-   CST\_: detailed annual undiscounted cost parameters; note that also
    the costs of past investments, which are constants in the objective
    function, are being reported;

-   PAR\_: various primal and dual solution parameters;

-   EQ(l)\_: directly accessed GAMS equation levels/marginals

-   REG\_: regional total cost indicators.

### Acronyms used in cost reporting parameters

The acronyms used in the reporting parameters for referring to certain
types of costs are summarized in Table 16. The acronyms are used as
qualifiers in the **uc_n** index of each reporting attribute, and are
accessible in VEDA-BE through that same dimension.

### The levelized cost reporting option

As indicated in Table 15 above, the reporting of levelized costs for
each process can be requested by setting the option RPT_OPT(\'NCAP\',
\'1\'). The results are stored in the VEDA-BE **Var_NcapR** result
attribute, with the qualifier \'LEVCOST\' (with a possible system label
prefix).

The levelized cost calculation option looks to weight all the costs
influencing the choice of a technology by TIMES. It takes into
consideration investment, operating, fuel, and other costs as a means of
comparing the full cost associated with each technology.

Levelized cost can be calculated according to the following general
formula:

    in year *t* (optional)

-   *BD~kt~* = revenues from by-product *k* in year *t* (optional; see
    below)

-   *MO~mt~* = output of main product *m* in year *t*

The exponent *t*--*0.5* in the formula indicates the good practice of
using mid-year discounting for continuous streams of annual
expenditures.

In TIMES, the specific investment, fixed and variable O&M costs and
fuel-specific flow costs are calculated directly from the input data.
However, for the fuel acquisition prices, emission prices and by-product
prices, ***commodity marginals*** from the model solution are used. All
the unit costs are multiplied by the corresponding ***variable levels***
as given by the model solution: investment cost and fixed operating
costs are multiplied by the amounts of capacity installed / existing,
variable operation costs by the activity levels, and fuel-specific costs
by the process flow levels. Mid-year discounting can also be activated.

The outputs of the main products are taken from the flow levels of the
commodities in the primary group (PG) of the process. An exception is
CHP processes, for which the elec­tricity output is considered the sole
main output, and heat is considered as a by-product.

**Options for variants of levelized cost reporting:**

1.  [Do not include emission prices or by-product revenues in the
    calculation]{.underline} (RPT_OPT('NCAP','1') = --1):

> In this option emission prices are omitted from the calculation, in
> accordance with the most commonly used convention for LEC calculation.
> Consequently, any by-product revenues need to be omitted as well,
> because if emissions have prices, the by-product prices in the
> solution would of course be polluted by those prices, and thus it
> would be inconsistent to use them in the calcu­lation. Instead, in this
> case any amount of by-product energy produced by ELE, CHP and HPL
> processes is indirectly credited by reducing the fuel-specific costs
> in the calculation to the fraction of the main output in the total
> amount of energy produced.

2.  [Include both emission prices and by-product revenues in the
    calculation]{.underline} (RPT_OPT('NCAP','1') = 1):

> In this option both emission prices and by-product revenues are
> included in the calculation. The levelized cost thus represents the
> unit cost after subtracting the levelized value of all by-products
> from the gross value of the levelized cost. This approach of crediting
> for by-products in the LEC calculation has been utilized, for example,
> in the IEA *Projected Costs of Generating Electricity* studies.

3.  [Include not only emission prices and by-product revenues, but also
    the revenues from the main product in the calculation]{.underline}
    (RPT_OPT('NCAP','1') = 2):

> This option is similar to option (2) above, but in this case all
> product revenues are included in the calculation, including also the
> peak capacity credit from the TIMES peaking equation (when defined).
> The calculated LEC value thus represents the levelized **net** unit
> cost after subtracting the value of all products from the gross
> levelized cost. For competitive new capacity vintages, the resulting
> levelized cost should in this case generally be *negative*, because
> investments into technologies that enter the solution are normally
> profitable. For the marginal technologies the levelized cost can be
> expected to be very close to zero. Only those technologies that have
> been in some way forced into the solution, e.g. by specifying lower
> bounds on the capacity or by some other types of constraints, should
> normally have a positive levelized cost when using this option.

In the TIMES calculation, the expenditures for technology investments
and process commodity flows include also taxes minus subsidies, if such
have been specified. The levelized costs are calculated by process
vintage, but only for new capacity vintages, as for them both the full
cost data influencing technology choice and the operating history
starting from the commissioning date are available, which is rarely the
case for existing vintages.

# Usage notes on special types of processes

## Combined heat and power

### Overview

Cogeneration power plants or combined heat and power plants (CHP) are
plants that consume one or more commodities and produce two commodities,
electricity and heat. One can distinguish two different types of
cogeneration power plants according to the flexibility of the outputs, a
back-pressure turbine process and a pass-out turbine process.

Back-pressure turbines are systems where the ratio of heat production to
electricity production is fixed, and the electricity generation is
therefore directly proportional to the heat generation. Pass-out
turbines are systems where the ratio of heat production to electricity
production is flexible, usually having a minimum value of zero and a
maximum value usually in the range of 0.8--3 (but can be even smaller or
larger).

However, both types of CHP systems often additionally support so-called
reduction operation, where the turbine can be by-passed, whereby all the
steam is directed to a heat exchanger for producing heat. As a result,
in a back-pressure turbine system, the ratio of heat production to
electricity production may in such systems vary from the fixed value to
infinity, and in a pass-out turbine system it may vary from zero to
infinity.

All these different cases are illustrated in Figure 10 below, which
shows the relations between heat and electricity production in different
modes of a flexible CHP system, of which the back-pressure turbine
system is a special case. Taking into account that thermal power plants
usually have a minimum stable operation level, the operating area of the
fixed back-pressure turbine system is represented by the line E--F in
the Figure. The corresponding operating area of a pass-out turbine
system (without reduction operation) is represented by the polygon
A--B--F--E. In some cases the turbine characteristics require a minimum
level of heat production in proportion to electricity, and with such a
constraint the feasible operating area is reduced to C--D--F--E.
Finally, with a reduction operation the feasible operating area is
expanded to the polygon C--D--F--H--G--E in the Figure. Similarly, the
operating area of a back-pressure turbine system with a reduction
operation capability would be expanded to E--F--H--G.

Denoting the electrical efficiency in the full condensing mode (point B)
by *η~B~* , the total efficiency in the full CHP mode (point F) by
*η~F~* , the heat-to-power ratio (inverse slope of line E--F) by *R*,
and the slope of the iso-fuel line (B--F) by *S*, we can easily write
the relations between these as follows:

#### Back-pressure turbine systems

For modelling a fixed back-pressure turbine system in TIMES, the
following approach is recommended:

-   Define the PCG of the process to consist of both the electricity and
    heat output commodities (using the set **prc_actunt**);

-   Define the process type to be CHP (using the set **prc_map**);

-   Use the electrical output as the basis of the process activity, and
    choose the capacity unit accordingly (using the parameter
    PRC_CAPACT).

-   Define the process electrical efficiency (by using the parameter
    ACT_EFF);

-   Define the process cost parameters accordingly; for example, specify
    the investment and fixed O&M costs per electrical capacity;

-   Define the fixed heat-to-power ratio (using the parameter
    NCAP_CHPR);

-   Optionally, define also a maximum annual utilization factor
    considering the typical optimal sizing of CHP plants in proportion
    to the heat demand in the heat network represented (using the
    parameter NCAP_AFA);

-   Optionally, define a minimum stable operation level (using
    ACT_MINLD).

All the input data specifications mentioned above should be quite
straightforward. Note that the NCAP_CEH parameter is not needed at all
in the fixed turbine case.

For back-pressure turbine technologies that have a reduction operation
capability, one can enable the reduction option by adding to the process
a third output of a dummy commodity, which is of type NRG and has a
limit type \'N\', and is also a member of the PCG. The model generator
will automatically assign such a dummy output to the reduction
operation, and will adjust the process transformation equation
accordingly.

#### Pass-out turbine systems

For modelling a flexible pass-out turbine system in TIMES, the following
approach is recommended (but see additional remarks below):

-   Define the PCG of the process to consist of both the electricity and
    heat output commodities (using the set **prc_actunt**);

-   Define the process type to be CHP (using the set **prc_map**);

-   Use the maximum electrical output as the basis of the process
    activity, and choose the capacity unit accordingly (using the
    parameter PRC_CAPACT). [^35]

-   Define the process electrical efficiency according to the maximum
    electrical efficiency (at point D in Figure 10), by using the
    parameter ACT_EFF;

-   Define the process cost parameters accordingly, for example, specify
    the investment and fixed O&M costs per unit of electrical capacity;

-   Define the maximum heat-to-power ratio (excluding any reduction
    operation), and optionally also the minimum heat-to-power ratio
    (using the parameter NCAP_CHPR);

-   Define the slope S of the iso-fuel line (the line B--F in Figure 10)
    by specifying NCAP_CEH=S (where --1 \< S \< 0, as in Figure 10);

-   Optionally, define also a maximum annual utilization factor
    considering the typical optimal sizing of CHP plants in the heat
    network represented (using the parameter NCAP_AFA and/or NCAP_AFC);

-   Optionally, define a minimum stable operation level (using
    ACT_MINLD).

Again, the specifications should be quite straightforward. The slope S
of the iso-fuel line represents the amount of electricity lost per heat
gained. In the example of Figure 10, the inverse of the slope has the
value 7 and so one would define NCAP_CEH = --1/7.

Alternatively, if it would seem more convenient to define both the
condensing mode efficiency and the full CHP efficiency, that can be done
by using the parameters NCAP_CDME (condensing mode efficiency) and
NCAP_BPME (back-pressure mode efficiency). When these two parameters are
used, the NCAP_CEH and ACT_EFF parameters should then not be used at
all. The activity will in this alternative approach always represent the
electricity output in condensing mode.

For pass-out turbine technologies that have a reduction operation
capability, one can enable the reduction option by adding to the process
a third output of a dummy commodity, which is of type NRG and has a
limit type \'N\', and is also a member of the PCG. The model generator
will automatically assign such a dummy output to the reduction
operation, and will adjust the process transformation equation
accordingly.

#### Alternative choices for defining the activity basis

As indicated above, the recommended basis of the activity of a CHP
technology is the maximum electricity output, because the available
technology data is usually best suited for using the electricity output
as the basis for the activity. However, also the total energy output in
full CHP mode can be used as the basis for the activity, should that be
a more convenient way of defining the process data.

The table below summarizes the different options modelling CHP processes
according to the choice of the main efficiency parameters. Note that the
cases with --1 \< CEH ≤ 0 and\
0 ≤ CEH \< 1 are identical when there is no lower bound for NCAP_CHPR
specified, apart from the handling of emission factors defined using the
\'ACT\' placeholder in FLO_EMIS.

## Inter-regional exchange processes 

### Structure and types of endogenous trade

In TIMES, the inter-regional trading structure of a given commodity
basically consists of one or several exchange processes (called IRE
processes), each of which defines a portion of the trading network for
the com­modity. The individual sub-networks can be linked together
through common inter­mediating regions. As an example, electricity trade
can be conveniently described by bi-lateral exchange processes (see
Figure 12). But bi-lateral trading between all pairs of regions may
become onerous in terms of data and model size. It is therefore useful
to consider the other trade structure of TIMES, called multi-lateral
trade, where regions trade with a common market (Figure 11). For either
structure, the topology of the trading possibilities are all defined via
the set **top_ire** of quintuples {r1,c1,r2,c2,p}, where **r1**, **r2**
are the exporting and importing regions respectively, **c1**, **c2** are
the names of the traded commodity in regions **r1** and **r2**
respectively, and **p** is the process identifier. Process **p** is a
process in both regions. It has to be defined only once, but one can add
parameters to it in both regions (e.g. costs, bounds, etc.). Nearly
every piece of data in TIMES has to be assigned to a region.

![](media/image16.wmf)

Figure

 11. General structure of the pair-wise specification of the trading
sub-network allowed in TIMES for a single exchange process.

TIMES provides considerable flexibility in the definition of trading
structures. Each sub-network defined for a single exchange process can
have the general structure shown in Figure 11. A trading structure that
involves both several supply (export) regions and several demand
(import) regions cannot be defined without introducing an inter­mediating
\'market\' region (R~M~). Whenever such an intermediate region is
defined between (at least) two different regions, the model generator
will assume that the structure is actually meant to ignore the
intermediate node-region shown in Figure 11, by generating a single
trade balance equation directly between all the export and all the
import flows. If the intermediate step should nonetheless be included,
for example, to reflect a physical market hub in the region R~M~, this
can be accomp­lished by dividing the sub-network into two parts, by using
two exchange pro­cesses. Con­sequently, depending on the user\'s choice,
the trading relationships shown in Figure 11 can be modeled both with
and without the intermediate transportation step through the market
region.

The general structure allowed for the trading sub-networks can be
further divided into four cases, which will be discussed below in more
detail:

-   Case 1: Bi-lateral trading.

-   Case 2: Unidirectional trade from some export regions into a single
    importing region

-   Case 3: Multi-directional trade from a single export region to
    several importing regions

-   Case 4: General multi-lateral trading structure

![](media/image17.wmf)

Figure

 12. Case 1: Bi-lateral trade (both R~1~ and R~2~ qualify as R~M~).

*[Trading without need for explicit marketplace definition]{.underline}*

Cases 1, 2 and 3 fall in this category. Bi-lateral trade takes place
between pairs of regions. An ordered pair of regions together with an
exchange process is first identified, and the trade through the exchange
process is balanced between these two regions. Whatever amount is
exported from region *i* to region *j* is imported by region *j* from
region *i* (possibly with an adjustment for trans­portation losses). The
basic structure is shown in Figure 12. Bi-lateral trading can be fully
described in TIMES by specifying the two pair-wise connections in
**top_ire**. The capacity and investment costs of the exchange process
can be described individually for both regions. For Cases 2 and 3, the
general structure of the trade relationships is shown in Figure 13. Also
in these cases the definition of the trading structure is easy, because
the relation­ships can be unambiguously described by pair-wise
**top_ire** specifications between two regions.

*[Trading based on marketplace]{.underline}*

Case 4 is covered by the generic structure shown in Figure 11. Trading
occurs in this case between at least three regions, and involves both
several exporting regions and several importing regions. In this type of
trade, the commodity is 'put on the market' by each region participating
in the supply side of the market and may be bought by any region
participating in the demand side of the mar­ket. This case is convenient
for global commodities such as emission permits or crude oil where the
transportation cost from R~i~ to R~j~ may be approximated by
Cost~i~+Cost~j~ (rather than a more accurate cost such as C~ij~). When
the exact cost (or losses) are strictly dependent on the pair i,j of
trading regions, it may be more accurate to use bilateral trade.

In general, there are many different possibilities for defining the
multi-lateral structure by using the pair-wise **top_ire**
specifications. In order to comply with the structure allowed in TIMES,
the user has to decide which of the regions represents the
\'marketplace\', i.e. is chosen to be the R~M~ shown in Figure 11. Note
that the market region will participate both in the supply and demand
side of the market. The TIMES model generator automatically identi­fies
this general type of trading on the basis of the **top_ire** topology
defined by the user. Therefore, the user only needs to define the
possible trading relationships between regions into the set **top_ire**.
If there are ***n*** supply regions and ***m*** demand regions, the
total num­ber of entries needed in **top_ire** for defining all the trade
possibilities is ***n+m--2*** (coun­ting the market region to be included
in both the supply and demand regions. Although the market region has to
be defined to be an intermediate node in the structure, the model
gene­rator will actually [not]{.underline} introduce any intermediate
step between the export and import regions.

The timeslice levels of the traded commodity may be different in each
region (as well as the commodity name). However, some appropriate common
timeslice level must be chosen for writing the market balance equation.
*That common level is the level attached to the exchange process in the
market region*. In all other respects, ***the market region is not
treated in any way differently*** from the other regions participating
in the market. Never­theless, the user can of course provide different
data for the different regions, for example investment costs or
efficiencies for the exchange process can be differentiated by region.

![](media/image18.wmf)

Figure

 13. General structure of unidirectional trade into a single import
region (Case 2, left) and multidirectional trade from a single export
region (Case 3, right).

If the sets of supply and demand regions participating in the market
should actually be disjoint, even in that case the user has to choose
one of the regions to be used as the intermediate market region. The
imports to or exports from the market region can then be switched off by
using an IRE_XBND parameter, if that is considered necessary.

*[Remarks on flexibility]{.underline}*

1.  Any number of exchange processes can be defined for describing the
    total trade relationships of a single commodity (but see warning 1
    below).

2.  The names of traded commodities can be different in each region
    participating in the trade. In addition, also the import and export
    names of the traded commodities can be different (but see warning 2
    below). This could be useful e.g. in the case of electricity, for
    which it is common to assume that the export commodity is taken from
    the system after grid transport, while the import commodity is
    introduced into the system before the grid.

3.  Any number of commodities can be, in general imported to a region or
    exported from a region through the same process (but see warning 2
    below).

*[Warnings]{.underline}*

1.  For each exchange process of any traded commodity, the total
    structure of the trading sub-network, as defined in **top_ire**,
    must comply with one of the basic structures supported by TIMES
    (Cases 1--4). If, for example, several bi-lateral trading
    relationships are defined for the same com­modity, they should, of
    course, not be defined under the same process, but each under a
    different process.

2.  If the export and import names for a market-based commodity (c) are
    different in the market region, no other commodities should be
    imported to the market region through the same exchange process as
    commodity c.

3.  The model generator combines the trading relationships of a single
    process into a single market whenever there is an intermediate
    region between two different regions. If, however, the intermediate
    exchange step should be explicitly included in the model, the
    trading sub-network should be divided between two different exchange
    processes.

*[Example]{.underline}*

Assume that we want to set up a market-based trading where the commodity
CRUD can be exported by regions A, B, C, and D, and that it can be
imported by regions C, D, E and F. First, the exchange process and
marketplace should be defined. For example, we may choose (C,XP,CRUD) as
the marketplace, where XP has been chosen to be the name of the exchange
process (recall that process XP is declared only once but exists in all
trading regions, possibly with different parameters). The trade
possibilities can then be defined simply by the following six
**top_ire** entries:

SET PRC / XP /;

SET TOP_IRE /

A .CRUD .C .CRUD .XP

B .CRUD .C .CRUD .XP

D .CRUD .C .CRUD .XP

C .CRUD .D .CRUD .XP

C .CRUD .E .CRUD .XP

C .CRUD .F .CRUD .XP

/;

To complete the RES definition needed for the exchange process, in
addition only the set **prc_actunt(r,p,c,u)** needs be defined for the
exchange process XP:

SET PRC_ACTUNT /

A .XP .CRUD .PJ

B .XP .CRUD .PJ

C .XP .CRUD .PJ

D .XP .CRUD .PJ

E .XP .CRUD .PJ

F .XP .CRUD .PJ

/;

These definitions are sufficient for setting up of the market-based
trade. Additionally, the user can, of course, specify various other data
for the exchange processes, for example investment and distribution
costs, efficiencies and bounds.

### Input sets and parameters specific to trade processes

TIMES input SETs that have a special role in trade processes are the
following:

-   **top_ire(r1,c1,r2,c2,p):** For bi-lateral trade, unidirectional
    trade into a single destination region, and multidirectional trade
    from a single source region, **top_ire** should contain the
    corresponding entries from the exporting region(s) **r1** to the
    importing region(s) **r2**.\
    For market-based trade, **top_ire** must contain entries for each
    exporting region to the intermediate market region, and from the
    market region to each importing region. Each region may be both
    exporting and importing. One may thus force even a bi-lateral
    exchagne to be modeled as market-based trade, by introducing an
    additional **top_ire** entry within the desired market region
    between the exported and imported commodity. .Instead of two trade
    balance equations, only one market balance equation is then
    generated.

-   **prc_aoff(r,p,y1,y2):** Override used to control in what years (not
    periods) a process is unavailable. This set is not specifically
    related to exchange processes. However, in the case of market-based
    trading it can be used to switch off the entire commodity market for
    periods that fall within the range of years given by **prc_aoff**.
    The market will be closed for all commodities exchanged through the
    process (**p**). If trading should be possible only between certain
    years, even multiple entries of **prc_aoff** can be specified.

All the **top_ire** specifications are handled for the user by the user
shell (VEDA/ANSWER) according to the characterization of the trade
processes.

> *[Additional remarks]{.underline}:*

1.  Commodity type can be used as the primary group of IRE processes.
    > All com­modi­ties of that type, traded through the process, will
    > then be included in the PCG.

2.  Topology entries are automatically created on the basis of
    > IRE_FLOSUM and FLO_EMIS defined for IRE processes (the latter only
    > for ENV commodities).

3.  In any non-bilateral trade, the marketplaces are automatically set
    > by the model generator for any trade that involves an intermediate
    > region between two different regions for the same exchange process
    > (**p**) and same commodity (**c**), or if there are multiple
    > destination (importing) regions for the same exporting region.

4.  In market-based trade with **r** as the market region, the
    > import/export regions partici­pating in the market consist of all
    > those regions that import/export com­modity **c** from/into region
    > **r** through process **p** (as defined in **top_ire**). The
    > market region **r** by itself always participates in the market
    > both as an importing and exporting region. However, the
    > imports/exports of commodity (**c**) to/from the market region
    > (**r**) can be switched off by using an IRE_XBND parameter, if
    > necessary.

**[Input parameters]{.underline}**

                          both regions are internal. Note that separate IRE_FLOs
                          are required for import and export. Default =1 for

1.  In market-based trading the IRE_FLO parameter is taken into account
    > on the export side only (representing the efficiency from the

### Availability factors for trade processes

In TIMES, capacity by default bounds only the activity. However, with
the NCAP_AFC / NCAP_AFCS attributes, one can bound the import / export
flows instead. Capacity then also refers to the nominal maximum import
(or export) capacity, e.g. the capacity of a transmission line in either
direction. One can thus simultaneously bound the import and export flows
by the same capacity but with different availabilities, which can be
useful with bi-directional exchange links with different availabilities
in the import/export direction. All these availability factors can be
defined either on a desired timeslice level (NCAP_AFC), or on individual
timeslices (NCAP_AFCS).

The rules for defining the availabilities for trade flows can be
summarized as follows:

-   If the import/export commodities are different (c1/c2): Use
    > NCAP_AFC(c1) for bounding the import flow and NCAP_AFC(c2) for
    > bounding the export flow, or use NCAP_AFC(\'NRG\') for applying
    > the same availability to both flows.

-   If input=output=c, specifying ***either*** NCAP_AFC(c) ***or***
    > NCAP_AFC(\'NRG\') alone applies to both imports and exports
    > (unless the process type is DISTR, see Section 4.2.4 below).
    > However, if they are both specified, then NCAP_AFC(c) applies to
    > the import flow while NCAP_AFC(\'NRG\') applies to the export
    > flow.

*[Remarks:]{.underline}*

1.  As any process has only a single capacity variable, the
    > availabilities specified for the import/export flows are always
    > proportional to the same overall capacity.

2.  Note that any the availability factors defined by NCAP_AFC are
    > multiplied by any NCAP_AF/NCAP_AFS/NCAT_AFA value if defined for
    > the same timeslice.

### Notes on other attributes for trade processes

There are important limitations of using the parameters for standard
processes for IRE processes. The most important limitations are
summarized Table 20 with regard to the parameters with the prefixes
\'ACT\_\', \'FLO\_\' and \'PRC\_\'. In addition, none of the CHP
parameters, storage parameters (STG\_\*), or dispatching parameters
(ACT_MINLD, ACT_UPS, ACT_CSTUP, ACT_LOSPL, ACT_CSTPL, ACT_TIME), can be
used for IRE processes, and are ignored if used.

  : Table 21: Specific TIMES parameters related to the modelling of
  storage processes.

Additional remarks with respect to inter-regional trade (IRE) processes:

-   By using the process type indicator \'DISTR\', the activity and
    capacity of an IRE process will be based on the import flow only, if
    the same commodity is both imported and exported. In this case also
    NCAP_AFC(c) will only apply to the import flow of c.

-   In peaking equations, IRE processes are by default taken into
    account by having gross imports on the supply side and gross exports
    on the consumption side. By defining the IRE process as a member of
    the set PRC_PKNO, and also defining NCAP_PKCNT\>0, only the net
    imports are taken into account on the supply side, which can be
    useful for regions having trade flows passing through the region.

## Storage processes 

### Overview

The TIMES model generator provides tools for specifying the following
types of storage processes:

-   Standard timeslice storage (STG without additional storage type
    qualifier)

-   Generalized timeslice storage (STG+STS)

-   Day/night storage (STG+NST, or just NST if at ANNUAL level)

-   Inter-period storage (STG+STK)

The process type indicator STG is automatically assigned also to all
processes that have been defined to be of type STS, NST or STK, with the
exception of ANNUAL level NST processes, which are implemented as normal
processes (see Section 4.3.3 below). Therefore, the user only needs to
specify one of {STG, STS, NST, STK} as the process type of a storage
process.

In addition to the charged and discharged commodity, storage processes
can also produce and consume auxiliary commodities (emissions,
electricity, fuels, waste etc.). The flows of such auxiliary commodities
can be defined to be proportional either to the activity, the main input
flows, or the main output flows of the storage (see Section below).

### Timeslice storage

The standard timeslice storage operates within the timeslice cycles
under the timeslices of the level immediately above the process
timeslice level. Consequently, the commodity charged can be only stored
over the cycle of timeslices under a single parent timeslice, and not
between timeslices under different parent timeslices. For example, a
standard DAYNITE level storage can only store the charged commodity over
the timeslices under one season, and not between seasons.

The activity of a timeslice storage represents the storage level, i.e.
the amount of energy/material stored in the storage, measured at the
beginning of each timeslice. However, one should note that for a DAYNITE
level storage, the level of the activity variable for each timeslice is
the actual storage level multiplied by the number of days under the
parent timeslice, in the same way as the level of the activity variables
for standard processes is the daily activity in that timeslice
multiplied by the number of days under the parent timeslice.

If a storage technology is capable of storing energy for longer periods
than over daily cycles, one may consider combining a SEASON/WEEKLY level
storage process with a DAYNITE storage. However, a DAYNITE level storage
may also be generalized to provide a storage capability between seasons,
and even between periods, by using the generalized timeslice storage
type qualifier \'STS\' (and both \'STS\' and \'STK\', if the
inter-period storage capability should be included). Because the same
storage capacity can be utilized on all timeslice levels, the general
storage process type may thus provide a somewhat improved modeling of a
multi-cycle storage.

### Day/Night storage

Day/Night storage (NST) is a timeslice storage, which can store energy
over the day-night cycles, but not over weekly or seasonal cycles. In
its basic functionality, an NST storage does not differ much from a
standard timeslice storage, the main difference being that one can
define the charging timeslices by specifying them in the set
**prc_nstts**.

Day/Night storage processes that produce ANNUAL level demand commodities
can be modeled either as genuine storage processes or as standard
processes with a night storage capability. In both cases \'NST\' should
be specified as the process type. If the process itself is defined to
operate at the DAYNITE level, the process will be a genuine storage
process, but if it is defined to operate at the ANNUAL level, it will be
a standard process. For any such night storage devices, the charging and
discharging commodity may be different, as defined via the set **top**.

When the NST process **p** is a genuine storage process, the input set
**prc_nstts**(r,p,s) may be used for defining the charging timeslices
**s**. Discharging can then only occur in timeslices other than the
charging timeslices. Defining **prc_nstts** is required for all other
genuine NST processes, except those serving an ANNUAL level demand,
which can always discharge at the level of the demand, regardless of any
**prc_nstts** defined.

In both types of NST storage, if the process is serving any ANNUAL level
demand, the demand commodity is produced according to the load curve,
while the charging can be optimized so that it occurs at night
timeslices only. However, when the NST process is a normal process, it
can be described in all other respects just as any other end-use
technologies. For example, electric heating systems with accumulators
can be described basically in the same way as direct electric heating
systems, but with the additional night storage capability.

### Inter-period storage

An inter-period storage process is able to store energy or material over
periods. For example, a coal stockpile or a waste disposal site can be
modeled as an inter-period storage. All inter-period storage processes
should be defined to operate at the ANNUAL level, unless the generic
timeslice process characterization (STS) is also specified.

The initial stock of an inter-period storage process can be specified by
using the STG_CHRG parameter, which is interpolated such that it always
includes the year at the beginning of the model horizon (B(t1)--1). The
value of STG_CHRG in the year B(t1)--1 is used as the initial stock for
inter-period storage. The allocation of the initial stock between the
process vintages that are available at the beginning of the model
horizon is left to be optimized by the model.

The activity of an inter-period storage is measured at the end of each
period. Therefore, either by setting a lower bound on the activity or on
the process availability, the storage can be prevented from getting
fully discharged during any period. However, as there is no explicit
accounting of the salvage value of the remaining contents of an
inter-period storage, it may also be considered reasonable to allow
discharging the storage fully in the last period, for taking into
account the value of the storage.

### Auxiliary storage flows

Storage processes can have any amount of auxiliary input or output
commodities, as long as they are distinct from the main storage
commodity. The flows of the auxiliary commodities can only be defined to
be fixedly proportional either to the activity, the main input flows, or
the main output flows. The main flows of timeslice and inter-period
storage processes are the flows of the charged and discharged
commodities included in the set primary commodity group PCG of the
process. In the day/night storage processes, the main flows consist of
all commodities in the primary and shadow groups of the process (see
documentation).

The relation between the auxiliary flows and the activity or main flows
should be defined by using the PRC_ACTFLO and the FLO_FUNC parameters.
For example, if the main storage flows of the process consist of the
commodity \'STORED\', and the auxiliary commodity is \'AUX\', the
auxiliary flow can be defined in the three following ways, corresponding
to the cases where the auxiliary flow is proportional to the activity,
the input flow, or the output flow, respectively:

PRC_ACTFLO(r,t,p,\'AUX\') ! AUX proportional to activity

FLO_FUNC(r,t,p,\'STORED\',\'AUX\',s) ! AUX proportional to input flow

FLO_FUNC(r,t,p,\'AUX\',\'STORED\',s) ! AUX inversely proportional to
output flow

These auxiliary storage flow relations have been implemented by adding a
new TIMES equation EQ_STGAUX(r, v, t, p, c, s). As the auxiliary storage
flows are represented by standard flow variables, any flow-related cost
attributes and UC constraints can be additionally defined on these
auxiliary flows. However, no transformation equations can be defined
between any auxiliary storage flows. Therefore, if, for example, some
auxiliary flows should also produce emissions, also these emissions
should be defined on the basis of the activity or main flows, and not by
defining a relation between the auxiliary flow and the emission flow.
Consequently, it is required that all auxiliary commodity flows related
to storage processes, whether energy, material, or emissions, are
described by using the three types of relations shown above.

A concrete example where these enhancements to the storage processes can
be very useful is the modeling of waste management, and, in particular,
the modeling of landfilling of different types of waste. Using
inter-period storage processes for this purpose makes it possible to
conveniently incorporate e.g. the following features in the waste
management model:

-   Modeling of methane emissions from landfilling in a dynamic way by
    using first-order decay functions for the gradual waste
    decomposition (optionally with different rates of decay for
    different waste qualities);

-   Modeling of other waste management and emission reduction options
    both before and after landfilling;

-   Incorporating gate fees to landfill sites (by defining costs on an
    input-based auxiliary storage flow).

### Input sets and parameters specifically related to storage processes

**[Input sets]{.underline}**

There is only one TIMES input SETs specifically related to storage:
prc_nstts. However, there are important storage-specific aspects related
to each of the following input sets:

-   **prc_map(r,prc_grp,p):** Defines the process as a storage process,
    where **prc_grp**=STG/STS/NST/STK according to the desired storage
    type.

-   **prc_actunt(r,p,cg,units_act):** Definition of the
    commodity/commodities in the PCG, i.e. those that are stored. Set of
    quadruples such that the members of the commodity group **cg** is
    used to define the charged and discharged commodity of storage
    process **p**, with activity units **units_act**, in region **r**.
    If the charged and discharged commodities are different, the group
    **cg** should preferably contain both of them, but if the user shell
    does not allow that, the model generator will automatically assign
    to the PCG any commodities on the shadow side that are of the same
    type than those already in the PCG, and are not verified to be
    auxiliary commodities. A commodity type can also be used as the
    primary group of storage processes. All commodities of that type
    will then be included in the PCG.

-   **top(r,p,c,io):** Definition of the charged (io=IN) discharged
    (io=OUT) and optional auxiliary input/output commodities for storage
    process p in region r. The set **top_ire** should thus first and
    foremost contain the input/output indicators for the stored
    commodities defined by **prc_actunt** (see above), but should
    include also any auxiliary input/output commodities assumed for the
    process. When the charged and discharged commodity is the same, that
    commodity can optionally be defined only as an input or only as an
    output, and in that case it will be connected to the commodity
    balance equations either only on the production or only on the
    consumption side, instead of being connected on both sides.

-   **prc_nstts(r,p,s):** For genuine night storage process **p** in
    region **r**, defines the timeslices **s** to be the charging
    timeslices, at which discharging cannot occur.

*[Remarks]{.underline}*

In TIMES, the input (charge) and output (discharge) commodity of a
storage process is usually the same commodity (input=output). When so,
and this commodity is defined both as an input and an output of the
process, the input and output flows will be taken into account in the
commodity balance equations on different sides: the input on the
consumption side, and the output on the production side.

However, in some cases this design has proven to be undesirable, because
due to the nature of the storage processes, the input and output flows
can usually be made arbitrarily large without affecting the storage
operation or costs. That is so because the input flow may also by-pass
the storage in the same timeslice or period, without being stored, and
will then be directly converted into the output flow, without any costs
or efficiency losses (unless STG_EFF is being used). Such arbitrary
input/output flows can also make the total commodity production
arbitrarily large, thereby rendering VAR_COMPRD a very unreliable
measure of the size of the commodity market. This can be undesirable
with respect to various market-share constraints that are usually
defined on the basis of the VAR_COMPRD values.

In order to avoid any arbitrary storage flows on the production or
consumption side, the input/output flows can be defined to be both
connected either on the production or consumption side, instead of being
on different sides. This will prevent the undesirable impacts of such
arbitrary flows. The desired side can be chosen by the user by defining
the commodity only as an output (production side) or as an input
(consumption side).

**[Input parameters]{.underline}**

The TIMES input parameters that are specific to storage processes or
have a specific functionality for storage processes are summarized in
Table 21.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Attribute name\  **Description**
  (indexes)**        
  ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------
  STG_CHRG\          Exogenous amount assumed to be charged into storage
  (r,y,p,s)          **p**, in timeslice **s** and year **y**. For timeslice
                     storage this parameter can be specified for each
                     period, while for inter-period storage this parameter
                     is only taken into account for the first period, to
                     describe the initial content of the storage at the
                     beginning of the model horizon. Units: Unit of the
                     storage input flow.

  STG_EFF\           Coefficient that represents the storage efficiency of a
  (r,y,p)            storage process **p** in region **r**. Applied at the
                     commodity balance to the output flow.

  STG_LOSS\          Coefficient that represents the annual storage losses
  (r,y,p,s)          of a storage process **p** in region **r**, as a
                     fraction of the (average) amount stored, corresponding
                     to a storage time of one year. If the value specified
                     is negative, the corresponding annual losses are
                     interpreted as an annual equilibrium loss (under
                     exponential decay).

  STG_MAXCYC\        Defines a limit for the storage cycling within each
  (r,y,p)            period, by giving the maximum number of cycles over the
                     full lifetime for process **p**, region **r**.

  STG_SIFT\          Defines the storage process **p** as a special
  (r,y,p,c,s)        load-shifting storage process for commodity **c**, and
                     defines the maximum fraction of shifted loads in
                     proportion to the demand. See section 4.3.9 for
                     additional information.

  STGIN_BND\         Bound on the input flow of commodity **c** of storage
  (r,y,p,c,s,bd)     process **p** in a timeslice **s**. Units: Unit of the
                     storage input flow. (Default value: none)

  STGOUT_BND\        Bound on the output flow of commodity **c** of storage
  (r,y,p,c,s,bd)     process **p** in a timeslice **s**. Units: Unit of the
                     storage input flow. (Default value: none)

  FLO_FUNC\          Defines the ratio between the flow of commodity **c2**
  (r,y,p,c1,c2,s)    and the flow of commodity **c1**, in timeslice **s**,
                     in other words, an efficiency coefficient giving the
                     flow of commodity **c2** per one unit of flow of
                     commodity **c1**. For storage processes, can be used
                     for defining amount of discharge in **c2** per unit of
                     auxiliary flow of **c1**, or amount of auxiliary flow
                     of **c2** per unit of charging in **c1**.

  PRC_ACTFLO\        Defines a conversion coefficient between the activity
  (r,y,p,c)          and the flow in commodity **c**. For storage processes,
                     PRC_ACTFLO can be used for the commodities in the PCG
                     in the standard way, but also for defining the amount
                     of auxiliary flow of **c** per unit of activity.

  NCAP_AFC\          Can be used for defining availability factors for the
  (r,y,p,cg,tslvl)   process activity (amount stored), process output flow,
                     or process input flow, or any combination of these. See
                     Section 6.3 for additional information.

  NCAP_AFCS\         As NCAP_AFC above, but can be specified for individual
  (r,y,p,cg,s)       timeslices. NCAP_AFCs values override NCAP_AFC values
                     defined at the same level.

### Availability factors for storage processes

In TIMES, capacity by default bounds only the activity. For storage,
this means the amount of stored energy. However, with the
NCAP_AFC/NCAP_AFCS attributes, one can bound the output (or input) flows
instead. Capacity then also refers to the nominal output (or input)
capacity, e.g. electrical capacity of a pumped hydro power plant. In
addition, one can bound simultaneously both the output and input flows
by the capacity, which can be useful if the charging rate is limited by
the capacity as well. Moreover, one can simultaneously define a bound
also for the activity (the amount stored) in proportion to the same
capacity variable. All these availability factors can be defined either
on a desired timeslice level (NCAP_AFC), or on individual timeslices
(NCAP_AFCS).

The rules for defining the availabilities for storage flows/activity can
be summarized as follows:

-   If the input/output commodities are different (c1/c2): Use
    > NCAP_AFC(c1) for bounding the input flow and NCAP_AFC(c2) for
    > bounding the output flow.

-   If input=output=c, NCAP_AFC(\'NRG\') will define the availability
    > factor for both the input and output flow, while NCAP_AFC(c) will
    > define the availability factor for the output flow only,
    > overriding any NCAP_AFC(\'NRG\') value if that is also specified
    > (assuming NRG is the type of the stored commodity).

-   NCAP_AFC(r,y,p,\'ACT\',tsl) can additionally be used for bounding
    > the activity (the amount stored); in this case one must bear in
    > mind that any capacity expressed in power units (e.g. MW/GW) is
    > assumed to represent a gross storage capacity equivalent to the
    > amount produced by full power during one full year/week/day for
    > SEASON/WEEKLY/DAYNITE level storage processes, respectively,
    > assuming STG_EFF=1. Knowing this, the availability factor can be
    > adjusted to correspond to the assumed real storage capacity. For
    > example, a capacity of 1 GW is assumed to represent a storage
    > capacity of 24 GWh for a DAYNITE storage, and if the real daily
    > storage capacity is, say 8 GWh / GW, the maximum availability
    > factor should be 0.333 / STG_EFF, on the DAYNITE level.

*[Remarks:]{.underline}*

1.  As any storage process has only a single capacity variable, the
    > assumption is that the availabilities specified for the
    > output/input flows and the activity are all proportional to the
    > same capacity.

2.  Note that any the availability factors defined by NCAP_AFC are
    > multiplied by any NCAP_AF/NCAP_AFS/NCAP_AFA value if defined for
    > the same timeslice.

### Notes on other attributes for storage processes

There are important limitations of using standard processes parameters
for storage processes. The most important limitations are summarized in
Table 22, with regard to the parameters with the prefixes \'ACT\_\',
\'FLO\_\' and \'PRC\_\'. In addition, none of the CHP parameters, IRE
parameters (IRE\_\*), or dispatching parameters (ACT_MINLD, ACT_UPS,
ACT_CSTUP, ACT_LOSPL, ACT_CSTPL, ACT_TIME), can be used for storage
processes, and are ignored if used.

*[Additional remark on peaking equations]{.underline}:*

-   In peaking equations, storage processes producing the peaking
    commodity are by default taken into account by their capacity on the
    supply side, and not at all by their flows (charging/discharging).
    By defining the storage process as a member of the set PRC_PKNO, and
    also defining NCAP_PKCNT\>0, the discharge from the storage is taken
    into account on the supply side instead of the capacity, and the
    charging into the storage is included on the consumption side
    (should such happen in the peak timeslice). That can be recommended,
    whenever the capacity represents the amount stored, and not the
    output capacity, and may be reasonable even for storage processes
    where the capacity represents the nominal maximum output flow.

### Load-shifting storage processes

In TIMES, load-shifting for demands can be modelled by introducing load
shifting processes, which are special storage processes where the input
/ output flows represent demand shifting upwards and downwards. For
utilizing this built-in support for modelling demand shifting operation
for a demand or final energy commodity *D*, the user would thus need to
define a storage process *P*, such that the *D* is both an input and an
output (or more generally, the input could also be another commodity
upstream). In addition, the user only needs to define the proportional
limits for the allowed demand shifting, by using the attribute
*STG_SIFT(r,t,p,c,s)*, on the DAYNITE level, optionally also on next the
level above. The dedicated load shifting constraints will then be
generated for the process (see Equation *EQ_SLSIFT* for the constraint
formulations).

This approach based on a storage process may be more convenient than
manual constraints, because for the process the user will also be able
to define investment costs, fixed O&M cost and variable costs for the
demand shifting operation, and one would able to refer to the process
activity and capacity variables easily in additional user constraints,
if needed. Unlike for normal storage, the activity of the load-shifting
processes is defined to be the output flow, and so the capcity
represents the maximum level of the shifted loads. Preventing load
shifting in either direction in any individual time-slices would also be
easy by bounding the corresponding process flows to zero using
*STGIN_BND* / *STGOUT_BND*.

The following constraints can be modelled for load-shifting processes:

-   Maximum allowed fractions of loads shifted (required, defined by
    *STG_SIFT*);

-   Seasonal balance equations (automatically generated);

-   Standard capacity-activity equations (optional, when the capacity is
    modelled);

-   User-defined balance constraints over sets of adjacent time-slices
    (optional, defined by *ACT_TIME*);

-   Maximum allowed time to meet the shifted loads either in advance or
    with delay (optional, defined by *ACT_TIME*);

-   Capacity bounds, activity bounds, flow bounds (optional).

The following types of costs can be modelled for load-shifting
processes:

-   Activity costs (cost on the discharge flow, using *ACT_COST*);

-   Flow costs (cost on the charging and/or discharging flows, using
    *FLO_COST* and/or *FLO_DELIV*);

-   Capacity cost (cost on the discharge load capacity, using
    *NCAP_COST*);

-   Fixed O&M cost (cost on the discharge load capacity, using
    *NCAP_FOM*);

-   Cost of shifting of one unit of demand load by one hour, forward
    (UP) and/or backward (LO) (using *ACT_CSTRMP*).

# Variables

This chapter describes each variable name, definition, and role in the
TIMES Linear Program. To facilitate identification of the variables when
examining the model's source code, all variable names start with the
prefix VAR\_. The value assigned to each variable indexed by some time
period, represents the average value in that time period, but the case
of VAR_NCAP(v) is an exception, since that variable represents a
point-wise investment decided at time period **v**. VAR_NCAP is
discussed in detail below.

is a list of TIMES variables by category, with brief description of each
variable.

**Remarks on Table 23:**

-   Many variables that are related to a process have two period
    indexes: **t** represents the current period, and **v** represents
    the vintage of a process, i.e. the period when the investment in
    that process was decided. For the VAR_NCAP variable, **t** is by
    definition equal to **v**. For other variables, **t** ≥ **v**, if
    the process is vintaged (**prc_vint**), i.e., the characteristics of
    the process depend on the vintage year. If the process is
    non-vintaged, the characteristics of the capacity of a process are
    not differentiated by its vintage structure, so that the vintage
    index is actually not needed for the variables of a non-vintaged
    process. In these cases, the vintage index **v** is by convention
    set equal to the period index **t**.

-   In , the variables are listed according to five categories,
    depending on what TIMES entity they represent. In the rest of the
    chapter, the variables are listed and fully described in
    alphabetical order.

-   does not list the variables used in the Climate Module, Damage Cost
    and ETL extensions of TIMES, which are fully documented in
    Appendices A, B, and C, respectively.

-   In the Objective function category, also lists several parameters
    that stand for certain portions of the objective functions. These
    are not bona fide GAMS variables, but mostly serve as convenient
    placeholders for this documentation, and also as useful parameters
    that may be reported in the solution.

**[Notation for indexes]{.underline}**: The following indexes are used
in the remainder of this chapter:

**r, r'** = region; **v** = vintage; **t, t'** = time period; **y** =
year; **p** = process; **c, c'** = commodity; **s**, **s'** = timeslice;
**ie** = import or export; ***l*** = sense of a constraint (≥, =, or ≤).
In addition, some indexes (**u; ble; opr; j; uc_n**) are used for
specific variables only and are defined in their context.

## VAR_ACT(r,v,t,p,s)

> **Definition:** the overall activity of a process. VAR_ACT is defined
> by the EQ_ACTFLO equation either as the sum of outflows or as the sum
> of inflows of a particular (user selected) group of commodities,
> adequately normalized. If the process is not vintaged, the vintage
> index **v** is by convention set equal to the period index **t**.
>
> **Role:** reports the activity of a process and implicitly defines how
> the capacity is measured, since the activity is bounded by the
> available capacity in the constraint EQ(*l*)\_CAPACT, e.g. if the
> activity of a coal power plant is defined over its electricity output,
> the capacity is measured in terms of the output commodity, e.g.
> MW~electric~. Similarly, if the activity variable represents the input
> flow of coal, the capacity of the coal plant is measured in terms of
> the input commodity, e.g. MW~coal~.
>
> **Bounds:** Can be directly bounded by ACT_BND
>
> **User constraints:** Can be directly referred to by UC_ACT

## VAR_BLND(r,ble,opr)

> **Definition:** amount of the blending stock **opr** in energy, volume
> or weight units needed for the production of the blending product
> **ble** in oil refinery modeling.
>
> **Role:** used for specifying constraints on quality of the various
> refined petroleum products.
>
> **Bounds:** Cannot be bounded.
>
> **User constraints:** Cannot be referred to in user constraints.

## VAR_CAP(r,t,p) 

> **Definition:** the installed capacity in place in any given year
> **t**, of all vintages of a process determined by the equation
> EQ(*l*)\_CPT. The variable is equal to the sum of all previously made
> investments in new capacity, plus any remaining residual capacity
> installed before the modeling horizon,that has not yet reached the end
> of its technical lifetime, and minus any capacity that has been
> retired early.
>
> **Role:** Its main purpose is to allow the total capacity of a process
> to be bounded. The variable is only created when

-   capacity bounds (CAP_BND) for the total capacity installed are
    specified. In case only one lower or one upper capacity bound is
    specified, the variable is not generated, but the bound is directly
    used in the EQ(l)\_CPT constraint.

-   the capacity variable is needed in a user constraint, or

-   the process is a learning technology (**teg**) in case that
    endogenous technological learning is used.

> **Bounds:** Can be directly bounded by CAP_BND
>
> **User constraints:** Can be directly referred to by UC_CAP

## VAR_COMNET(r,t,c,s)

> **Definition:** the net amount of a commodity at period **t**,
> timeslice **s**. It is equal to the difference between amount procured
> (produced plus imported) minus amount disposed (consumed plus
> exported). []{.mark}
>
> **Role:** The variable is only created if a bound is imposed, or a
> cost is explicitly associated with the net level of a commodity.
>
> **Bounds:** Can be directly bounded by COM_BNDNET
>
> **User constraints:** Can be directly referred to by UC_COMNET

## VAR_COMPRD(r,t,c,s)

> **Definition:** the amount of commodity **c** procured at time period
> **t**, timeslice **s**, after applying the commodity efficiency
> COM_IE.
>
> **Role:** this variable is only created if a bound is imposed on total
> production of a commodity, or a cost is explicitly associated with
> production level of a commodity. The variable is defined through the
> equation EQE_COMPRD. []{.mark}
>
> **Bounds:** Can be directly bounded by COM_BNDPRD
>
> **User constraints:** Can be directly referred to by UC_COMPRD

## VAR_CUMCOM(r,c,type,y1,y2)

> **Definition:** the cumulative amount of commodity **c** produced in
> region **r** between years **y1** and **y2**, over all timeslices. The
> **type** indicator (PRD/NET) distinguishes between gross and net
> production.
>
> **Role:** this variable is only created if a bound is imposed on
> cumulative gross/net production of a commodity. The variable is
> defined through the equations EQ_CUMPRD and EQ_CUMNET.
>
> **Bounds:** Can be directly bounded by COM_CUMNET/ COM_CUMPRD
>
> **User constraints:** Can be directly referred to by UC_CUMCOM

## VAR_CUMCST(r, y1,y2,costagg,cur)

> **Definition:** the cumulative amount of costs/taxes/subsidies
> according to the aggregation **costagg** in region **r** between years
> **y1** and **y2**, over all timeslices. The available cost
> aggregations are identified by the pre-defined members of the fixed
> index set **costagg**.
>
> **Role:** this variable is only created if a bound is imposed on the
> cumulative amount of regional costs, taxes, and/or subsidies. The
> variable is defined through the equation EQ_BNDCST.
>
> **Bounds:** Can be directly bounded by REG_CUMCST
>
> **User constraints:** Cannot be referred to in user constraints

## VAR_CUMFLO(r,p,c,y1,y2)

> **Definition:** the cumulative amount of flow in commodity **c** by
> process **p** in region **r** between years **y1** and **y2**, over
> all timeslices. With the commodity name **c=**\'ACT\' (reserved system
> label), the variable represents the cumulative amount of process
> activity.
>
> **Role:** this variable is only created if a bound is imposed on the
> cumulative amount of process flow or activity. The variable is defined
> through the equation EQ_CUMFLO.
>
> **Bounds:** Can be directly bounded by FLO_CUM / ACT_CUM
>
> **User constraints:** Can be directly referred to by
> UC_CUMFLO/UC_CUMACT

## VAR_DNCAP(r,t,p,u) / VAR_SNCAP(r,t,p)

> **Definition:** VAR_DNCAP is only used for processes selected by the
> user as being discrete, i.e. for which the new capacity in period
> **t** may only be equal to one of a set of discrete sizes, specified
> by the user. For such processes, VAR_DNCAP is a binary decision
> variable equal to 1 if the investment is equal to size **'u'** and 0
> otherwise. Thanks to an additional constraint, only one of the various
> potential sizes allowed for the investment at period **t** is indeed
> allowed.
>
> VAR_SNCAP is only used for processes selected by the user as having
> semi-continuous amounts of new capacity, i.e. for which new capacity
> in period **t** may only be zero or between positive lower and upper
> bounds specified by the user.
>
> **Role:** useful to mathematically express the fact that investment in
> process **p** at period **t** may only be done in discrete or
> semi-continuous sizes. See equation EQ_DSCNCAP in Chapter 6.
>
> **Bounds:** Direct bounding not available, indirectly by NCAP_BND
>
> **User constraints:** Not available

> specified by the user. For such processes, VAR_DRCAP is an integer

## VAR_ELAST(r,t,c,s,j,l)

> **Definition:** these variables are defined whenever a demand is
> declared to be price elastic. These variables are indexed by **j**,
> where **j** runs over the number of steps used for discretizing the
> demand curve of commodity **c** (**c** = energy service only). The
> **j**^th^ variable stands for the portion of the demand that lies
> within discretization interval **j**, on side ***l*** (***l***
> indicates either increase or decrease of demand w.r.t. the reference
> case demand). Each ELAST variable is bounded upward via virtual
> equation EQ_BNDELAS.

## VAR_FLO(r,v,t,p,c,s) 

> **Definition**: these variables stand for the individual commodity
> flows in and out of a process. If the process is not vintaged, the
> vintage index **v** is by convention set equal to the period index
> **t**.
>
> **Role**: The flow variables are the fundamental quantities defining

## VAR_IRE(r,v,t,p,c,s,ie)

> **Definition: t**he inter-regional exchange variable (i=IMPort,
> e=EXPort) that tracks import (**ie**=i) or export (**ie**=e) of a
> commodity between region **r** and other regions. The region(s) **r'**
> trading with **r** is (are) not specified via this variable, but
> rather via the process(es) **p** through which the import/export is
> accomplished. The topology set **top_ire(r,c,r',c',p)** of an exchange
> process indicates the (single) region **r'** with which region **r**
> is trading commodity **c** (which may have a different name **c'** in
> region **r')**. Each trade process may trade more than one commodity.
> Otherwise, VAR_IRE operates in a manner similar to VAR_FLO for
> conventional processes. An option exists for trading with an external
> region that is not modeled explicitly (exogenous trading). If the
> process is not vintaged, the vintage index **v** is by convention set
> equal to the period index **t**.
>
> **Role:** the role of an IRE variable is to embody the amount of a

##  VAR_NCAP(r,v,p)

> **Definition:** the amount of new capacity (or what has traditionally
> been called "investment" in new capacity, or capacity build-up) at
> period **v**. As will be explained in Section 6.2.2, VAR_NCAP
> represents the total investment in technology **p** at period **v**
> only when ILED+TLIFE ≥ D(v), where D(v) is the period length. And, as
> discussed further in that Section, when ILED+TLIFE \< D(v), the model
> assumes that the investment is repeated as many times as necessary
> within the period so that the life of the last repetition is beyond
> the end of period **v**. In this case VAR_NCAP represents the capacity
> level of the single investments. Figure 1 illustrates a case where the
> investment is made twice in period **v** (and some capacity still
> remains after period **v**). The average capacity in period **v**
> resulting from the investment VAR_NCAP(v) is less than VAR_NCAP(v),
> due to the delay ILED (it is equal to VAR_NCAP(v)\* D(v)/TLIFE). The
> average capacity in period **v+1** due to VAR_NCAP(v) is also less
> than VAR_NCAP(v) because the end of life of the second round of
> investment occurs before the end of period **v+1**. These adjustments
> are made in every equation involving VAR_NCAP by the internal
> parameter COEF_CPT.

## Variables used in User Constraints 

The remaining TIMES variables are all attached to user constraints. User
constraints are quite flexible, and may involve any of the usual TIMES
variables. Two variants of formulating user constraints exist. In the
first case a LHS expression, containing expressions involving the
different TIMES variables, are bounded by a RHS constant (given by the
input parameter UC_RHS(R)(T)(S)). In the second case, the constant on
the RHS is replaced by a variable. The bound UC_RHS(R)(T)(S) is then
applied to this variable. In the latter case, the user constraints are
always generated as strict equalities, while in the first case the
equation sign of the user constraint is determined by the bound type.

-   Case 1 (RHS constants): \<LHS expression\> ≤/=/≥ UC_RHS(R)(T)(S)

-   Case 2 (UC variables): \<LHS expression\> = VAR_UC(R)(T)(S)

These user constraint variables are in fact redundant, but quite useful
in providing streamlined expressions constraints (see Chapter 6), and
allow for reporting the slack level of each UC. Morever, in the case of
range constraints, they will reduce model size and the amount of input
data. By setting the dollar control parameter VAR_UC to YES in the
run-file, the variable based formulation is activated (second case). By
default, the formulation without user constraint variables will be used,
and only the marginals of the equations are reported.

Non-binding user constraints (intoduced for reporting purposes) can only
be defined when the user constraint variables are used (i.e. VAR_UC ==
YES).

Each of the listed variables is related to a specific class of user
constraint depending on whether the user constraint is created for each
period, region, or time slice or only a subset of these indices. In
addition, some user constraints are defined for pair of successive time
periods (dynamic user constraint or growth constraint). Each variable
has at least one index (representing the user constraint **uc_n** for
which this variable is defined), and may have up to three additional
indexes among **r**, **t**, and **s**.

### VAR_UC(uc_n) 

Variable representing the LHS expression of the user constraint
EQE_UC(uc_n) summing over regions (**uc_r_sum**), periods (**uc_t_sum**)
and timeslices (**uc_ts_sum**).

###  VAR_UCR(uc_n,r) 

Variable representing the LHS expression of the user constraint
EQE_UCR(r,uc_n) summing over periods (**uc_t_sum**) and timeslices
(**uc_ts_sum**) and being generated for the regions specified in
**uc_r_each**.

### VAR_UCT(uc_n,t)

Variable representing the LHS expression of the user constraint
EQE_UCT(uc_n,t) and the combined LHS--RHS expression of the user
constraint EQE_UCSU(uc_n,t), summing over regions (**uc_r_sum**) and
timeslices (**uc_ts_sum**) and being generated for the periods specified
in **uc_t_each/uc_t_succ**.

###  VAR_UCRT(uc_n,r,t)

Variable representing the LHS expression of the user constraint
EQE_UCRT(r,uc_n,t) and the combined LHS--RHS expression of the user
constraint EQE_UCRSU(r,uc_n,t), summing over timeslices (**uc_ts_sum**)
and being generated for the regions specified in **uc_r_each** and
periods in **uc_t_each/uc_t_succ**.

###  VAR_UCTS(uc_n,t,s) 

Variable representing the LHS expression of the user constraint
EQE_UCTS(uc_n,t,s) and the combined LHS--RHS expression of the user
constraint EQE_UCSUS(uc_n,t,s), summing over regions (**uc_r_sum**) and
being generated for the periods specified in **uc_t_each/uc_t_succ** and
timeslices in **uc_ts_each**.

###  VAR_UCRTS(uc_n,r,t,s)

Variable representing the LHS expression of the user constraint
EQE_UCRTS(r,uc_n,t,s) and the combined LHS--RHS expression of the user
constraint EQE_UCRSUS(r,uc_n,t,s), being generated for the regions
speci­fied in **uc_r_each**, the periods in **uc_t_each/uc_t_succ** and
the timeslices in **uc_ts_each**.

# Equations 

This chapter is divided into four sections: the first section describes
the main notational conventions adopted in writing the mathematical
expressions of the entire chapter. The next two sections treat
respectively the TIMES objective function and the standard linear
constraints of the model. The fourth section is devoted to the facility
for defining various kinds of user constraints. Additional constraints
and objective function additions that are required for the Climate
Module, Damage Cost and Endogenous Technology Learning options are
described in Appendices A, B and C, respectively.

Each equation has a unique name and is described in a separate
subsection. The equations are listed in alphabetical order in each
section. Each subsection contains successively the name, list of
indices, and type of the equation, the related variables and other
equations, the purpose of the equation, any particular remarks applying
to it, and finally the mathematical expression of the constraint or
objective function.

The mathematical formulation of an equation starts with the name of the
equation in the format: *EQ_XXX~i,j,k,l~* , where *XXX* is a unique
equation identifier, and *i,j,k,..,* are the *equation indexes*, among
those described in chapter 2. Some equation names also include an index
*l* controlling the sense of the equation. Next to the equation name is
a *logical condition* that the equation indexes must satisfy. That
condition constitutes the *domain of definition* of the equation. It is
useful to remember that the equation is created in multiple instances,
one for each combination of the equation indexes that satisfies the
logical condition, and that each index in the equation's index list
remains *fixed* in the expressions constituting each instance of the
equation.

## Notational conventions 

We use the following mathematical symbols for the mathematical
expressions and relations constituting the equations:

The conditions that apply to each equation are mathematically expressed
using the ![](media/image20.wmf)symbol (meaning "such that" or "only
when"), followed by a logical expression involving the usual logic
operators: ![](media/image21.wmf) (AND), ![](media/image22.wmf)(OR), and
NOT.

Within the mathematical expressions of the constraints, we use the usual
symbols for the arithmetic operators (![](media/image23.wmf)etc).

However, in order to improve the writing and legibility of all
expressions, we use some simplifications of the usual mathematical
notation concerning the use of multiple indexes, which we describe in
the next two subsections.

### Notation for summations 

When an expression *A(i,j,k,...)* is summed, the summation must specify
the range over which the indexes are allowed to run. Our notational
conventions are as follows:

When a single index j runs over a one-dimensional set A, the usual
notation is used, as in: ![](media/image24.wmf) where *A* is a single
dimensional set.

When a summation must be done over a subset of a multi-dimensional set,
we use a simplified notation where some of the running indexes are
omitted, if they are not active for this summation.

[Example]{.underline}: consider the 3-dimensional set *top* consisting
of all quadruples *{r,p,c,io}* such that process *p* in region *r*, has
a flow of commodity *c* with orientation *io* (see table 3 of chapter
2). If is it desired to sum an expression *A~r,p,c,io~* over all
commodities c, keeping the region (r), process (p) and orientation (io)
fixed respectively at *r~1~*, *p~1~* and 'IN', we will write, by a
slight abuse of notation: ![](media/image25.wmf) , or even more simply:

![](media/image26.wmf), if the context is unambiguous. Either of these
notations clearly indicates that *r, p* and *io* are fixed and that the
only active running index is *c*.

(The traditional mathematical notation would have been:
![](media/image27.wmf), but this may have hidden the fact that *c* is
the only running index active in the sum).

### Notation for logical conditions 

We use similar simplifying notation in writing the logical conditions of
each equation. A logical condition usually expresses that some parameter
exists (i.e. has been given a value by the user), and/or that some
indexes are restricted to certain subsets.

A typical example of the former would be written as:
![](media/image28.wmf)*ACTBND~r,t,p,s,bd~*, which reads: "the user has
defined an activity bound for process *p* in region *r*, time-period
*t*, timeslice *s* and sense *bd*". The indexes may sometimes be
omitted, when they are the same as those attached to the equation name.

A typical example of the latter is the first condition for equation
*EQ_ACTFLO~r,v,t,p,s~* (see section 6.3.4), which we write simply as:
![](media/image29.wmf), which is short for: ![](media/image30.wmf), with
the meaning that "some capacity of process *p* in region *r*, created at
period *v*, exists at period *t*". Again here, the indices have been
omitted from the notation since they are already listed as indices of
the equation name.

### Using Indicator functions in arithmetic expressions

There are situations where an expression A is either equal to B or to C,
depending on whether a certain condition holds or not, i.e.:

![](media/image31.wmf)

This may also be written as:

![](media/image32.wmf)

where it is understood that the notation (Cond) is the *indicator
function* of the logical condition, i.e. (Cond)=1 if Cond holds, and 0
if not.

This notation often makes equations more legible and compact. A good
example appears in EQ_CAPACT.

## Objective function EQ_OBJ

**Equation EQ_OBJ**

**Indices: region (r); state of the world (w); process (p); time-slice
(s); and perhaps others \...**

**Type: = Non Binding (MIN)**

**Related Variables: All**

**Purpose**: the objective function is the criterion that is minimized
by the TIMES model. It represents the total discounted cost of the
entire, possibly multi-regional system over the selected planning
horizon. It is also equal to the negative of the discounted total
surplus (plus a constant), as discussed in PART I, chapters 3 and 4.

### Introduction and notation

The TIMES objective function includes a number of innovations compared
to those of more traditional energy models such as MARKAL, EFOM,
MESSAGE, etc. The main design choices are as follows:

-   The objective function may be thought of as the discounted sum of
    *net annual costs* (i.e. costs minus revenues), as opposed to *net
    period costs*[^39]. Note that some costs and revenues are incurred
    after the end of horizon (EOH). This is the case for instance for
    some investment payments and more frequently for payments and
    revenues attached to decommissioning activities. The past
    investments (made before the first year of the horizon) may also
    have payments within horizon years (and even after EOH!) These are
    also reflected in the objective function. However, it should be
    clear that such payments are shown in OBJ only for reporting
    purposes, since such payments are entirely *sunk*, i.e. they are not
    affected by the model's decisions.

-   The model uses a general discount rate *d(y)* (year dependent), as
    well as technology specific discount rates *d~s~(t)* (period
    dependent). The former is used to: a) discount fixed and variable
    operating costs, and b) discount investment cost payments from the
    point of time when the investment actually occurs to the base year
    chosen for the computation of the present value of the total system
    cost. The latter are used only to calculate the annual payments
    resulting from a lump-sum investment in some year. Thus, the only
    place where *d~s~(t)* intervenes is to compute the Capital Recovery
    Factors *(CRF)* discussed further down.

For convenience, we summarize below the notation which is more
especially used in the objective function formulation (see Section 6.1
for general notes on the notation) .

#### Notation relative to time

***MILESTONEYEARS:*** the set of all milestone years (by convention:
middle years, see below ***M(t)*** )

***PASTYEARS:*** Set of years (usually prior to start of horizon), for
which there is a past investment (*after* interpolation of user data).

***MODELYEARS:*** any year within the model's horizon

***FUTUREYEARS:*** set of years posterior to EOH

***YEARS*** set of years before during and after planning horizon

***t*** any member of ***MILESTONEYEARS*** or ***PASTYEARS***. By
convention, a period ***t*** is represented by its middle year (see
below ***M(t)***). This convention can be changed without altering the
expressions in this document.

***B(t)*** : the first year of the period represented by ***t***

***E(t)*** : the last year of the period represented by ***t***

***D(t)*** : the number of years in period ***t*** . By default,
***D(t)=1*** for all past years. Thus, ***D(t)=E(t)--B(t)+1***

***M(t):*** the "middle" year or milestone year of period ***t***. Since
period ***n*** may have an even or an odd number of years, ***M(t)*** is
not always exactly centered at the middle of the period. It is defined
as follows: ***M(t) = \[B(t)+(D(t)--1)/2\],*** where ***\[x\]***
indicates the largest integer less than or equal to ***x***. For
example, period from 2011 to 2020 includes 10 years, and its "middle
year" is \[2011+4.5\] or 2015 (slightly left of the middle), whereas the
period from 2001 to 2015 has 15 years, and its "middle year" is :
\[2001+7\] or 2008 (i.e. the true middle in this example)

***y*** : running year, ranging over ***MODELYEARS***, from ***B~0~***
to ***EOH***.

***k*** : dummy running index of any year, even outside horizon

***v***: running index for a year, used when it represents a vintage
year for some investment.

***v(p)*** vintage of process ***p*** (defined only if ***p*** is
vintaged)

***B~0~*** : initial year (the single year of first period of the model
run)

***EOH*** : Last year in horizon for a given model run.

Similarly, by a slight abuse of notation, the above entities are
extended as follows, when the argument is a particular year, rather than
a model year:

***B(y)*** : first year of the period containing year ***y*** (instead
of ***B(T(y))*** )

***T(y)*** the milestone year of the period containing year ***y***
(same as ***M(y)*** in our present convention)

***M(y)*** : "middle year" of the period containing year ***y***
(instead of ***M(T(y))*** )

***D(y)*** : number of years of the period containing year ***y***
(instead of ***D(T(y))***

#### Other notation

***d(y)*** : general (social) discount rate (time dependent, although
not shown in

notation)

***r(y)*** : general discount factor: ***r(y)=1/(1+d(y))*** (time
dependent, although not

shown in notation)

***d~s~(t)*** : technology specific discount rate (model year dependent)

***r~s~(t)*** : technology specific discount factor:

*ILED*≥0, although *ILED* can also be negative (causing the lead-time be
shifted ILED years backward).

***ILED~Min~* =*Min {1/10 \* D(t), 1/10 \* TLIFE~.~}*** This threshold
serves to distinguish small from large projects; it triggers a different
treatment of investment timing.

#### Discounting options

There are alternate discounting methods in TIMES. The default method is
to assume that all payments occur at the beginning of some year.
Alternate methods (activated by a switch, see PART III) assume that
investments are incurred at the beginning of some year, but that all
annual (or annualized) payments occur at the middle or at the end of the
corresponding year. Section 0 explains the different methods.

#### Components of the Objective function

The objective function is the sum of all regional objectives, all of
them discounted to the same user-selected base year, as shown in
equation (A) below

*EQ_OBJ(z)* ![](media/image34.wmf)

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image35.wmf)                                             *(A)*
  ------------------------------------------------------------------ -------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table A-2. Parameters of the climatic module (default values)

Each regional objective *OBJ(z,r)* is decomposed into the sum of nine
components, to facilitate exposition, as per expression (B) below.

*EQ_OBJ(z,r)* ![](media/image36.wmf)

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table A-4. Model variables specific to the Climate Module.

The regional index *r* is omitted from the nine components for
simplicity of notation.

The first and second terms are linked to investment costs. The third
term is linked to decommissioning capital costs, the fourth and fifth
terms to fixed annual costs, the seventh and eighth terms to all
variable costs (costs proportional to some activity), and the ninth to
demand loss costs. The tenth cost (actually a revenue) accounts for
commodity recycling occurring after *EOH*, and the eleventh term is the
salvage value of all capital costs of technologies whose life extends
beyond *EOH*. The 11 components are presented in the nine subsections
6.2.2 to 6.2.10.

### Investment costs: INVCOST(y)

This subsection presents the components of the objective function
related to investment costs, which occur in the year an investment is
decided and/or during the construction lead-time of a facility.

**Remarks**

a)  The investment cost specified by using the input attribute NCAP_COST
    should be the overnight investment cost (excluding any interests
    paid during construction) whenever the construction lead time is
    explicitly modeled (i.e. cases 2 are used, see below). In such a
    case, the interests during construction are endogenously calculated
    by the model itself, as will be apparent in the sequel. If no
    lead-time is specified (and thus cases 1 are used), the full cost of
    investments should be used (including interests during construction,
    if any)[^41].

b)  Each individual investment physically occurring in year *k,* results
    in a *stream of annual payments* spread over several years in the
    future. The stream starts in year *k* and covers years *k, k+1, ...,
    k+ELIFE-1,* where *ELIFE* is the economic life of the technology.
    Each yearly payment is equal to a fraction *CRF* of the investment
    cost (*CRF* = Capital Recovery Factor). Note that if the technology
    discount rate is equal to the general discount rate, then the stream
    of *ELIFE* yearly payments is equivalent to a single payment of the
    whole investment cost located at year *k*, inasmuch as both have the
    same discounted present value. If however the technology's discount
    rate is chosen different from the general one, then the stream of
    payments has a different present value than the lump sum at year
    *k*. It is the user's responsibility to choose technology dependent
    discount rates, and therefore to decide to alter the effective value
    of investment costs.

c)  In addition to spreading the payments resulting from investment
    costs, a major TIMES refinement is that the physical investment
    itself does not occur in a single year, but rather as a series of
    annual increments. For instance, if the model invests 3 GW of
    electric capacity in a period extending from 2011 to 2020, the
    physical capacity increase may be delayed and/or may be spread over
    several years. The exact way the delaying and spreading are effected
    depends on several conditions, which are specified further down as
    four separate cases, and which are functions both of the nature of
    the technology and of the length of the period in which the
    investment takes place relative to the technology's technical life.
    The spreading of investments and the spreading of payments described
    in the previous paragraph help guarantee a smooth trajectory for
    most investment payments, a more realistic representation than what
    happens in other models. The Case 1.a example given below shows a
    case where the physical investment is spread over four years, and
    each increment's capital payments are further spread over 3 years.

d)  The above two remarks entail that payments of investment costs may
    well extend beyond the horizon. We shall also see that some
    investment payments occur in years prior to the beginning of the
    planning horizon (cases 1 only).

e)  Taxes and subsidies on investments are treated exactly as investment
    costs in the objective function.

f)  Since the model has the capability to represent *sunk* materials and
    energy carriers (i.e. those embedded in a technology at construction
    time, such as the uranium core of a nuclear reactor, or the steel
    imbedded in a car), these sunk commodities have an impact on cost.
    Two possibilities exist: if the material is one whose production is
    explicitly modeled in the RES, then there is no need to indicate the
    cost corresponding to the sunk material, which will be implicitly
    accounted for by the model just like any other flow. If on the other
    hand the material is not speci­fically modeled in the RES, then the
    cost of the sunk material should be included in the technology's
    investment cost, and will then be handled exactly as investment
    costs.

**[The four investment cases]{.underline}**

As mentioned above, the timing of the various types of payments and
revenues is made as realistic and as smooth as possible. All investment
decisions result in increments and/or decrements in the capacity of a
process, at various times. These increments or decrements may occur, in
some cases, in one large lump, for instance in the case of a large
project (hydroelectric plant, aluminum plant, etc.), and, in other
cases, in small additions or subtractions to capacity (e.g. buying or
retiring cars, or heating devices). Depending on which case is
considered, the assumption regarding the corresponding streams of
payments (or revenues) differs markedly. Therefore, the distinction
between small and large projects (called cases 1 and 2 below) will be
crucial for writing the capital cost components of the objective
function. A second distinction comes from the relative length of a
project's technical life vs. that of the period when the investment
occurs. Namely, if the life of an investment is less than the length of
the period, then it is clear that the investment must be repeated all
along the period. This is not so when the technical life extends beyond
the period's end. Altogether, these two distinctions result in four
mutually exclusive cases, each of which is treated separately. In what
follows, we present the mathematical expression for the INVCOST
component and one graphical example for each case.

**Case 1.a** If ![](media/image38.wmf)

**(Small divisible projects, non-repetitive, progressive investment in
period)**

Here, we make what appears to be the most natural assumption, i.e. that
the investment occurs in small yearly increments spread linearly over
*D(t)* years. Precisely, the capacity additions start at year
*M(t)-D(t)+1,* and end at year M*(t),* which means that payments start
earlier than the beginning of the period, and end at the middle of the
period, see example. This seems a more realistic compromise than
starting the payments at the beginning of the period and stopping them
at the end, since that would mean that during the whole period, the paid
for capacity would actually not be sufficient to cover the capacity
selected by the model for that period.

![](media/image39.emf)

*EQ_INVCOST(y)*

![](media/image40.wmf) **(I.1.a)**

*Comments*: The summand represents the payment effected in year *y,* due
to the investment increment that occurred in year *v* (recall that
investment payments are spread over *ELIFE*). The summand consists of
three factors: the first is the amount of investment in year *v*, the
second is the capital recovery factor, and the third is the unit
investment cost.

The outer summation is over all periods (note that periods later than
*T(y)* are relevant, because when *y* falls near the end of a period,
the next period's investment may have already started). The inner
summation is over a span of *D(t)* centered at *B(t),* but truncated at
year *y*. Also, the lower summation bound ensures that an investment
increment which occurred in year *v* has a payment in year *y* only if
*y* and *v* are less than *ELIFE* years apart.

**Case 1.b** if ![](media/image41.wmf)

**Small projects, repeated investments in period**

Note that in this case the investment is repeated as many times as
necessary to cover the period length (see figure). In this case, the
assumption that the investment is spread over *D(t)* years is not
realistic. It is much more natural to spread the investment over the
technical life of the process being invested in, because this ensures a
smooth, constant stream of small investments during the whole period
(any other choice of the time span over which investment is spread,
would lead to an uneven stream of incremental investments). The number
of re-investments in the period is called *C*, and is easily computed so
as to cover the entire period. As a result of this discussion, the first
investment cycle starts at year ![](media/image42.wmf) (meaning the
smallest integer not less than the operand), and ends *TLIFE* years
later, when the second cycle starts, etc, as many times as necessary to
cover the entire period. The last cycle extends over the next period(s),
and that is taken into account in the capacity transfer equations of the
model. As before, each capacity increment results in a stream of *ELIFE*
payments at years *v, v*+1, etc.

![](media/image43.emf)

![](media/image44.wmf)

Relevant range for *y*:

![](media/image45.wmf)

**(I.1.b)**

*Comments:* the expression is similar to that in case **1.a**., except
that i) the investment is spread over the technical life rather than the
period length, and ii) the investment cycle is repeated more than once.

**Case 2.a:** ![](media/image46.wmf)

**(Large, indivisible projects, unrepeated investment in period)**

Here, it is assumed that construction is spread over the lead-time (a
very realistic assumption for large projects), and capacity becomes
available at the end of the lead time, **in a lump quantity** (see
figure).

![](media/image47.emf)

![](media/image48.wmf)

![](media/image49.wmf) (**I.2.a**)

*Comments:* The main difference with case I.1.a) is that the
investment's construction starts at year *B(t)* and ends at year
*B(t)+ILED~t~--1* (see example). As before, payments for each year's
construction spread over *ELIFE* years. Equation I.2.a also shows the
impact of negative *ILED*s, which is simply a shift of the lead-time
*ILED* years backwards.

**Case 2.b:** ![](media/image50.wmf)

**(Large, indivisible Projects, repeated investments in period)**

![](media/image51.emf)

This case is similar to case I.2.a, but the investment is repeated more
than once over the period, each cycle being *TLIFE* years long. As in
case I.2.a, each construction is spread over one lead time, *ILED*. In
this case, the exact pattern of yearly investments is complex, so that
we have to use an algorithm instead of a closed form summation.

### Taxes and subsidies on investments

We assume that taxes/subsidies on investments occur at precisely the
same time as the investment. Therefore, the expressions *INVTAXSUB(y)*
for taxes/subsidies are identical to those for investment costs, with
*NCAP_COST* replaced by: *(NCAP_ITAX -- NCAP_ISUB).*

### Decommissioning (dismantling) capital costs: *INVDECOM(y)*

**Remarks**

a)  Decommissioning physically occurs after the end-of-life of the
    investment, and may be delayed by an optional lag period *DLAG*
    (e.g. a "cooling off" of the process before dismantling may take
    place). The decommissioning costs follow the same patterns and rules
    as those for investment costs. In particular, the same four cases
    that were defined for investment costs are still applicable.

b)  The same principles preside over the timing of payments of
    decommissioning costs as were defined for investment costs, namely,
    the decomposition of payments into a stream of payments extending
    over the economic life of decommissioning, *DELIF.*

c)  At decommissioning time, the recuperation of embedded materials is
    allowed by the model. This is treated as explained for investment
    costs, i.e. either as an explicit commodity flow, or as a credit
    (revenue) subtracted *by the user* from the decommissioning cost.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
g)  Decommissioning activities may also receive taxes or subsidies which
    are proportional to the corresponding decommissioning cost.

![](media/image59.wmf)

**Case 1.a)** If ![](media/image38.wmf)

**(Small divisible projects, non-repetitive, progressive investment in
period)**

In this case, decommissioning occurs exactly *TLIFE+DLAG* years after
investment. For small projects (cases **1.a** and **1.b**), it is
assumed that decommissioning takes exactly one year, and also that its
cost is paid that same year (this is the same as saying that
*DLIFE=DELIF=1*). Any user-defined DLIFE/DELIF is in this case thus
ignored. This is a normal assumption for small projects. As shown in the
example below, also payments made at year *y* come from investments made
at period *T(y)* or earlier. Hence the summation stops at *T(y).*

![](media/image60.wmf) **(III.1.a)**

*Comment:* Note that the cost attribute is indexed at the year when the
investment started to operate. We have adopted this convention
throughout the objective function.

![](media/image61.emf)

**Case 1.b)** if ![](media/image41.wmf)

**(Small projects, repeated investments in period)**

This cost expression is similar to I.1.b, but with payments shifted to
the right by *TLIFE* (see example). The inner summation disappears
because of the assumption that *DELIF=1*. Note also that past
investments have no effect in this case, because this case does not
arise *when D(t)=1,* which is always the case for past periods.

![](media/image62.wmf)

> **(III.1.b)**

![](media/image63.emf)

**Case 2.a:** ![](media/image46.wmf)

**(Large, indivisible projects, unrepeated investment in period)**

In this situation, it is assumed that decommissioning of the plant
occurs over a period of time called *DLIFE*, starting after the end of
the technical process life *plus a time DLAG* (see example). *DLAG* is
needed e.g. for a reactor to "cool down" or for any other reason.
Furthermore, the payments are now spread over *DELIF,* which may be
larger than one year.

![](media/image64.wmf)

> **(III.2.a)**

![](media/image65.wmf)

![](media/image66.emf)

**Case 2.b:** ![](media/image67.wmf)

**(Big projects, repeated investments in period)**

Here too, the decommissioning takes place over *DLIFE*, but now,
contrary to case 2.a, the process is repeated more than once in the
period. The last investment has life extending over following periods,
as in all similar cases. The resulting stream of yearly payments is
complex, and therefore, we are forced to use an algorithm rather than a
closed form summation. See also example below.

### Fixed annual costs: FIXCOST(y), SURVCOST(y) 

The fixed annual costs are assumed to be paid in the same year as the
actual operation of the facility. However, the spreading of the
investment described in subsection 5.1.1 results in a tapering in and a
tapering out of these costs. Taxes and subsidies on fixed annual costs
are also accepted by the model.

There are two types of fixed annual costs, *FIXCOST(y)*, which is
incurred each year for each unit of capacity still operating, and
*SURVCOST(y)*, which is incurred each year for each unit of capacity in
its *DLAG* state (this is a cost incurred for surveillance of the
facility during the lag time before its demolition). Again here, the
same classification of cases is adopted as in previous subsections on
capital costs. Note that by assumption, *SURVCOST(y)* occurs only in
cases 2. DLAG is allowed to be positive even in case 1a, but that in
this case the surveillance costs are assumed to be negligible. Finally,
note that *FIXCOST(y)* need be computed only for years *y* within the
planning horizon, whereas *SURVCOST(y*) may exist for years beyond the
horizon

**Remark on early retirements:**

In TIMES, any capacity may also be retired before the end of its
technical lifetime, if so-called early retirements are enabled for a
process. In such cases, the plant is assumed to be irrevocably shut
down, and therefore fixed O&M costs would no longer occur. This
situation is not taken into account in the standard formulations given
below, but it has been taken into account in the model generator. To see
that the expressions for the fixed annual costs, taxes and subsidies
could be easily adjusted for early retirements, consider the standard
expressions for *FIXCOST(y)*, which can all be written as follows.

![](media/image73.wmf)

Here, *CF~r,v,p,y~* is the compound fixed cost coefficient for each
capacity vintage in year *y*, as obtained from the original expressions
for *FIXCOST(y)*. Recalling that fixed costs are accounted only within
the model horizon, these expressions can be adjusted as follows:

![](media/image74.wmf)

As one can see, the expressions for *FIXCOST(r,y)* can be augmented in a
straightforward manner, obtaining the expressions *FIXCOST°(r,y)* that
take into account early capacity retirements of each vintage,
represented by the *VAR_SCAP~r,v,t,p~* variables.

**Case 1.a)** If ![](media/image38.wmf)

**(Small projects, single investment in period)**

*EQ\_*![](media/image75.wmf) , *y ≤ EOH*

The figure of the example shows that payments made in year *y* may come
from investments made at periods before *T(y),* at *T(y)* itself, or at
periods after *T(y).* Note that the cost attribute is multiplied by two
factors: the *SHAPE*, which takes into account the vintage and age of
the technology, and the *MULTI* parameter, which takes into account the
pure time at which the cost is paid (the notation below for *SHAPE* and
*MULTI* is simplified: it should also specify that these two parameters
are those pertaining to the *FOM* attribute).

![](media/image76.wmf)

Example:

> ![](media/image77.emf) **\
> Case 1.b,** if ![](media/image41.wmf)

**(Small projects, repeated investments in period)**

The figure shows that payments made at year *y* may come from
investments made at, before, or after period *T(y)*. Note that our
expression takes into account the vintage and age of the *FOM* being
paid, via the *SHAPE* parameter, and also the pure time via *MULTI*,
both pertaining to the *FOM* attribute.

i)  *FIXCOST(y)*

The figure of the example shows that payments made in year *y* may come
from investments made at period *T(y)* or earlier, but not later. Again
here the *SHAPE* has the correct vintage year and age, as its two
parameters, whereas *MULTI* has the current year as its parameter. Both
pertain to *FOM*.

defined the *SHAPE* or *MULTI* parameters for surveillance costs.

*Remark*: same as precedently regarding the indexing of the cost
attribute *NCAP_DLAGC*

### Annual taxes/subsidies on capacity: FIXTAXSUB(Y) 

It is assumed that these taxes (subsidies) are paid (accrued) at exactly
the same time as the fixed annual costs. Therefore, the expressions
**IV** of subsection 5.1.4 are valid, replacing the cost attributes by
*NCAP_FTAX -- NCAP_FSUB. []{.mark}*

### Variable annual costs *VARCOST(y), y ≤ EOH*

Variable operations costs are treated in a straightforward manner (the
same as in MARKAL), assuming that each activity has a constant activity
over a given period.

In this subsection, the symbol *VAR_XXX~t~* is any variable of the model
that represents an activity at period *t*. Therefore, *XXX* may be *ACT,
FLO, COMX, COMT,* etc. Note that, if and when the technology is
vintaged, the variable has an index *v* indicating the vintage year,
whereas *T(y)* indicates the period when the activity takes place.
Similarly, the symbol *XXX_COST~k~* represents the value in year *k* of
any cost attribute that applies to variable *VAR_XXX*.

Finally, the expressions are written only for the years within horizon,
since past years do not have a direct impact on variable costs, and
since no variable cost payments occur after EOH. Note also that the
SHAPE and MULTI parameters are not applicable to variable costs.

As stated in the introduction, the payment of variable costs is constant
over each period. Therefore, the expressions below are particularly
simple.

![](media/image94.wmf) **(VI)**

### Cost of demand reductions ELASTCOST(y) 

When elastic demands are used, the objective function also includes a
cost resulting from the loss of welfare due to the reduction (or
increase) of demands in a given run compared to the base run. See PART I
for a theoretical justification, and Appendex D for formulations
involving more generalized demand fuctions.

![](media/image95.wmf)

![](media/image96.wmf)

**(VII)**

###  Salvage value: SALVAGE (EOH+1)

Investments whose technical lives exceed the model's horizon receive a
SALVAGE value for the unused portion of their technical lives. Salvage
applies to several types of costs: investment costs, sunk material
costs, as well as decommissioning costs and surveillance costs. SALVAGE
is reported as a single lump sum revenue accruing precisely at the end
of the horizon (and then discounted to the base year like all other
costs).

The salvaging of a technology's costs is an extremely important feature
of any dynamic planning model with finite horizon. Without it,
investment decisions made toward the end of the horizon would be
seriously distorted, since their full value would be paid, but only a
fraction of their technical life would lie within the horizon and
produce useful outputs.

What are the costs that should trigger a salvage value? The answer is:
any costs that are directly or indirectly attached to an investment.
These include investment costs and decommissioning costs. Fixed annual
costs and variable costs do not require salvage values, since they are
paid each year in which they occur, and their computation involves only
years within the horizon. However, surveillance costs should be
salvaged, because when we computed them in section 6.2.5, we allowed *y*
to lie beyond EOH (for convenience). Finally, note that any capacity
prematurely retired within the model horizon is not assumed to have a
salvage value (although this detail is not explicitly shown in the
formulation below).

Thus, *SALVAGE* is the sum of three salvage values

![](media/image97.wmf)

We treat each component separately, starting with *SALVINV.*

**A). Salvaging investment costs (from subsections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3)**

The principle of salvaging is simple, and is used in other technology
models such as MARKAL, etc: a technology with technical life *TLIFE*,
but which has only spent *x* years within the planning horizon, should
trigger a repayment to compensate for the unused portion *TLIFE-x* of
its active life.

However, the user can also request more accelerated functional
depreciation in the value of the capacity, by defining *NCAP_FDR~r,v,p~*
(representing additional annual depreciation in the value). For
simplicity, we apply the functional depreciation as an additional
exponential discounter.

The computation of the salvage value therefore obeys a simple rule,
described by the following result:

*Result 1*

The salvage value (calculated at year *k*) of a unit investment made in
year *k*,\
and whose technical life is *TL*, is:

![](media/image98.wmf)

where d is the general discount rate and FDR is the optional functional
depreciation rate

Note that the second case may indeed arise, because some investments
will occur even after *EOH.*

Since we want to calculate all salvages at the single year *(EOH+1)*,
the above expressions for *S(k,TL)* must be discounted (multiplied) by:

Finally, another correction must be made to these expressions, whenever
the user chooses to utilize a technology specific discount rate. The
correction factor which must multiply every investment (and of course
every salvage value) is:

**NOTE:** salvage cost of taxes/subsidies on investment costs are
identical to the above, replacing NCAP_COST by {NCAP_ITAX --
NCAP_ISUB}*.*

**B). Savage value of decommissioning costs (from subsection 6.2.4)**

For decommissioning costs, it should be clear that the triggering of
salvage is still the fact that some residual life of the *investment
itself* exists at *EOH+1*. What matters is *not* that the
decommissioning occurs after EOH, but that some of the investment life
extends beyond EOH. Therefore, Result 1 derived above for investment
costs, still applies to decommissioning. Furthermore, the correction
factor due to the use of technology specific discount rates is also
still applicable (with *ELIFE* replaced by *DELIF*).

However, the further discounting of the salvage to bring it to *EOH+1*
is now different from the one used for investments. The discounting
depends on the year *l* when the decommissioning occurred and is thus
equal to:

(1+*d*)^*EOH*+1--*l*^  where  *l*  is the year when decommissioning
occurs.

*l* depends on each case and will be computed below:

In cases 1.a and 1.b, *l=TLIFE + k*

In case 2.a *k* is fixed at *B(t)+ILED*, but *l* varies from
*(B(t)+ILED+TLIFE+DLAG)* to *(same +DLIFE--1)*

In case 2.b *k* is fixed at *B(t)+ILED+(C--1)*×*TLIFE*, but *l* varies
from *(B(t)+ILED+C*×*TLIFE+DLAG)* *to*

> *(same + DLIFE--1)*

It is helpful to look at the examples for each case in order to
understand these expressions.

Finally, the equivalent of Result 2 is given as Result 3, for
decommissioning.

each case.

**C) Salvage Value of Surveillance Costs**

Similarly to the salvaging of decommissioning costs, the basic salvage
value fractions *S(k,m)* defined in *Result 1* at the beginning of
Section 6.2.9 are used as the basis for the salvage value of
surveillance costs. However, unlike with decommissioning costs, there is
no need to make corrections for technology-specific discount rates, as
the costs do not represent capital costs. In addition, the discounting
to *EOH+1* must be made separately for each surveillance year. Note that
only Cases 2 have surveillance costs.

###  Late revenues from endogenous commodity recycling after EOH LATEREVENUE(y)

Late revenues consist of revenues from any materials and energy which
had been embedded in some processes, and which are released after *EOH*.
Such revenues exist only if an exogenous salvage value was declared by
the user for the sunk material.

*Note*: For materials released within the horizon, the revenue is either
explicit (and then it is the user's responsibility to indicate a
negative cost -- credit -- at dismantling time), or the revenue is
implicit, and then the user must specify a physical release of the
material at dismantling time, and the model will correctly 'price' this
material within the RES.

*LATEREVENUES(y) y ≥ EOH+1*

The late revenues come *only* from the resale at dismantling time, of
materials and/or energy that were sunk at construction time. Therefore,
the *LATEREVENUES* expressions are identical to the decommissioning cost
expressions, with the NCAP_DCOST attribute replaced by

![](media/image115.wmf)

where the summation extends over all commodities *c* for which an
*NCAP_OCOM* attribute is defined (defaults to zero if undefined)

*LATEREVENUES(y)* is reported as a lump sum discounted to the user
selected base year.

### Known issues in the standard objective function formulation

There are a few known issues in the standard objective function
formulation that may cause small distortions in the cost accounting and,
subsequently, in the relative competitiveness of technologies. The
distortions only occur when using period lengths D(t) \> 1. The issues
can be briefly summarized as follows:

-   In the investment cases 1.a and 1.b, the timing of the annual
    payments for the investment costs and fixed operation and
    maintenance costs are not fully in sync with the assumed amounts of
    available capacity. Although the effective difference is usually
    quite small, with longer periods having an even number of years, the
    distortion may become considerable.

-   In the investment cases 1.a and 1.b, the spreading of the investment
    cost over D(t) or TLIFE(p) years causes some distortions in the
    salvage value accounting, which are at the highest in cases where
    B(v)+TLIFE = EOH+1, (capacity is retired exactly at the end of the
    horizon), because in such cases the capacity is assumed fully
    available within the model horizon, but it still has a salvage value
    according to the standard formulation.

-   In all investment cases, the capacity is assumed to be available in
    each period according to the proportion of the period being covered
    by the years \[B(v)+ILED(v),B(v)+ILED(v)+TLIFE(v)--1\]. If all
    periods contain only a single year, this is quite accurate, but, due
    to discounting, it is no longer accurate with longer periods. That
    is because any capacity available in year y has a larger value than
    the same capacity available in year y+1. But again, this causes only
    a small distortion in the cost accounting.

-   With variable period lengths, investments for period t can start
    even before the previous milestone year t--1. If the investment
    costs are changing over time, in such cases the costs are not
    accounted in a fully consistent way, because the investment cost
    data is taken from the start year of each investment step.

The first three of these issues have been addressed by introducing an
optional switch (\$SET OBLONG YES), which, when activated, will
eliminate all those three issues. For the first two issues, the
discounting of the annual payments for the investment costs and fixed
operation and maintenance costs is slightly modified, such that the
weighted average of the commissioning years over the investment steps is
exactly equal to B(v) (the weights being the present value factors for
the commissioning years). In other words, the modification introduces a
small additional discounting multiplier, which moves the whole
investment spread slightly in time, such that the resulting costs will
effectively always be in sync with the assumed available capacity (and
activity).

For the third issue, the capacity transfer coefficients are slightly
modified to reflect the true value of the capacity in each period, based
on the *discounted* proportion of the period being covered by the
process lifetime.

The modified objective function has been verified to produce results
that are fully consistent with single-year period results, assuming that
process parameters do not change over time, which is the best what one
can expect. The fourth issue can only be addressed by using any of the
alternative objective formulations (see separate *Objective Function
Variants* documentation, available at the ETSAP documentation website).

### The discounting methods for annual payments

In the standard objective function of TIMES, all costs and payments are
assumed to occur at the begin­ning of each year. In the case of
investment costs, this means that the annualized payments made in the
beginning of each year within the economic lifetime are equivalent to a
lump-sum invest­ment cost paid at the beginning of the first operation
year, if the annual payments are discounted back to that point by the
technology-specific discount rate (for instance, in case 1a, each lump
sum is equal to *NCAP_COST/D*(*t*)). Simi­larly, in the case of operation
costs (e.g. *NCAP_FOM)*, the total annual costs are assumed to occur at
the beginning of each operating year.

Because the operating costs can nevertheless be assumed to be spread
continuously throughout the year, this kind of \'beginning-of-year\'
discounting method introduces a small bias in the discounting of
different cost components. For example, the operating costs in the first
year of operation should be assumed to occur about half a year later in
time compared to the investment, and not at the same time, as assumed in
TIMES. One may well argue that this time-difference should be reflected
in the discounting applied.

In TIMES, there is an option to correct this small bias by using
mid-year discounting, or even end-of-year discounting. The options can
be activated by the switch *MID_YEAR / DISCSHIFT* (see Part III, Control
switches). The modifications needed in the discounting are basically
quite similar for employing both mid-year and end-of-year discounting.
Therefore, only the corrections for mid-year discounting are described
in detail below.

The corrections needed for employing mid-year discounting in TIMES can
be made in the following two steps:

1.  First, simply assume that instead of the beginning of each year, all
    payments are made in the mid-point of each year in TIMES. As such,
    this assumption doesn\'t change the objective function in any way;
    it is only a change in thinking. However, it also means that instead
    of the beginning of the base year, all costs are assumed to be
    discounted to the mid-point of the base year.

2.  Second, make the necessary corrections to the discounting of all
    those cost components that cannot be assumed to be actually paid at
    the mid-point of the year.

By going through the various cost components, the following conclusions
hold for step 2:

-   All variable, fixed operation and surveillance costs can be assumed
    to be paid in the mid-point of each year, and no change is needed
    for them in the discounting.

-   The lump-sum investment costs in Cases 1 *(NCAP_COST/D(T))* should
    be assumed to occur at the beginning of the investment year instead
    of the mid-point.

-   All the lump-sum investment costs in Cases 2 *(NCAP_COST/ILED)* can
    be assumed to occur in the mid-point of each construction year.
    Therefore, no change is needed in the discounting of the annualized
    investment payments.

-   Decommissioning costs in Cases 1 can be assumed to be paid in the
    mid-point of the year, because in these cases decommissioning is
    assumed to take exactly one year, and one may assume that, on the
    average, the costs occur at the mid-point.

-   The lump-sum decommissioning costs in Cases 2 *(NCAP_DCOST/DLIFE)*
    can be assumed to occur at the mid-point of each year within the
    decommissioning lifetime. Therefore, no change is needed in the
    discounting of the annualized payments.

Consequently, the initial overall conclusion is that the only correction
needed in the discounting of various cost components is related to the
investment costs in Cases 1. If we assume that the Capital Recovery
Factor used in the beginning-of-year discounting (*CRF~beg~*) is still
valid for mid-year discounting, we should simply shift the position of
both the lump-sum investment and the annualized payments half a year
backwards. In terms of discounting, this means that in Cases 1 the
annualized investment payments should be multiplied by the factor
(1+*d(y)*)^0.5^, where *d(y)* is the **general discount rate**. Perhaps
the simplest way to apply this correction in the objective function is
to make the adjustment to the Capital Recovery Factor. Thus, for Cases 1
we could define a \'CRF corrected for mid-year discounting\'
(*CRF~1,mid~*) as follows:

> *CRF~1,mid~* = *CRF~beg~* × *(*1+*d*(*T*(y)))^0.5^

However, one could additionally argue that the Capital Recovery Factor
*CRF~beg~* is no longer valid for mid-year discounting. The annualized
investment payments can also be assumed to represent a continuous stream
of costs, which should thus be assumed to be paid at the mid-point of
each year. The shortcoming of the original *CRF~beg~* can be seen by
calculating its value for an investment with an economic lifetime of
just one year. The value of *CRF~beg~* is in this case exactly 1,
although it seems obvious that some interest should be involved as well.
Assu­ming that the single payment represents a continuous stream of
costs, the payment can be as­sumed to occur at the mid-point of the year,
and would thus include interest for half-year\'s time.

Accordingly, we should correct the definition of the *CRF proper* by
assuming that the annualized payments occur *half a year forward* in
time with respect to the lump-sum investment, which means that we must
increase the nominal size of the payments by the corresponding interest
for the half-year\'s time. Combining these corrections together, the
general discount rate *d*(*y*) should be simply replaced by the
**tech­nology-specific discount rate** *d~S~*(*T*(*y*)) in the expression
above, because in addition to the nominal change in the *CRF*, the time
of the annualized payments has been restored back to original. However,
to maintain consistency bet­ween Cases 1 and 2, the same basic correction
to the *CRF proper* should be applied to all cases. Therefore, the total
adjust­ments needed when taking into account the correction to the *CRF
proper* are the following:

+-------------------------------------------------------------+--------+
| > ![](media/image116.wmf) =  *CRF~beg~* ×                   | (XI.1) |

+=============================================================+========+
| > *CRF~1,mid~* = ![](media/image116.wmf)×                   | (XI.2) |
| > (1+*d*(*T*(*y*)))^0.5^ × (1+*d*(*T*(*y*)))^--0.5^ =\      |        |
| > *CRF~beg~* × (1+*d~S~*(*T*(*y*)))^0.5^                    |        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+--------+
| > *CRF~2,mid~*  =  ![](media/image116.wmf)×                 | (XI.3) |
| > (1+*d*(*T*(*y*)))^--0.5^ =  \                             |        |
| > *CRF~beg~* × (1+*d*(*T*(*y*)))^--0.5^ ×                   |        |
| > (1+*d~S~*(*T*(*y*)))^0.5^                                 |        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+--------+

: Table B-4. Constraints specific to damage costs (in the GAMS file
eqdamage.mod).

Consequently, in both cases the annualized investment payments are then
assumed to occur at the mid-point of each fiscal year starting at the
time of the lump-sum investment, and the annual pay­ments are equiva­lent
to the lump-sum investment when discounted back to that point by the
tech­nology-specific discount rate. The imple­mentation of the optional
corrections for mid-year dis­counting corresponds to equations (XI.1 to
XI.3). To be consistent, the expression (XI.3) for *CRF~2,mid~* should
also be used for decommissioning costs.

### Bound: BND_ELAST

**Indices:** **region (r), year (t), commodity (c), time slice (s),
linearization step (j), direction of elastic demand change (*l*)**

**Type:** **≤**

**Related variables:** **VAR_ELAST**

**Related equations:** **EQ(l)\_COMBAL, EQ_OBJELS, EQ_OBJ**

**Purpose**: Upper Bounds on the step variables used to represent the
demand when the elasticity is non-zero.

**Remarks:**

-   These bounds are applied whenever a demand is price elastic, i.e.
    when the COM_ELAST (elasticity) and COM_VOC (total range) parameters
    are specified and not zero.

-   If COM_ELAST and COM_VOC are specified, and COM_STEP (number of
    steps) is not, the latter defaults to 1 (single step discretization)

-   Attributes COM_VOC and COM_STEP do not have a timeslice index. The
    user can still control elasticities in each time slice through
    COM_ELAST~s~.

![](media/image117.wmf)

**Bound:**

### Equation EQ(*l*)\_ACTBND

**Indices**: **region (r), model year (t), process (p), time slice (s)**

**Type**: Any type, as determined by the index **bd** of ACT_BND:

-   *l* = 'G' for **bd** = 'LO' (lower bound) yields
    ![](media/image118.wmf).

-   *l* = 'E' for **bd** = 'FX' (fixed bound) yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

-   *l* = 'L' for **bd** = 'UP' (upper bound) yields
    ![](media/image120.wmf).

**Related variables**: **VAR_ACT**

**Related equations**: **EQ_COMBAL, EQ_ACTFLO, EQ_PTRANS**

**Purpose**: This equation bounds the total activity of a process in a
period independently of the vintage years of the installed capacities.
The equation will either be generated when the activity bound is
specified for a timeslice being at a timeslice level above the timeslice
level of the process (**prc_tsl**), e.g. ACT_BND is specified for an
ANNUAL timeslice but the process operates on a DAYNITE timeslice level,
or irrespectively of the timeslices when the process is characterized as
a vintaged one (**prc_vint**). If activity bounds are specified for
timeslices below the process timeslice level (**prc_tsl**), the bounds
will be aggregated to the process timeslice level by standard
aggregation (see Section 3.1.2) and then directly applied to the
activity variable for non-vintaged processes. The same is true for
activity bounds specified at the process timeslice level of non-vintaged
processes.

**Remarks**:

-   The equation is required because for the two cases described above
    (bound specified for a timelslice above the process timeslice level
    or process is characterized as a vintaged one), no single variable
    exists which can be bounded directly.

-   The bound is only directly applied to VAR_ACT for non-vintaged
    processes, when ACT_BND is applied at the level **prc_ts(r,p,s)~.~**

**Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: The level value of the equation describes the activity of the
process in the considered period **t** and timeslice **s**.

Dual: The dual variable describes in the case of a lower (upper) bound
the cost increase (decrease) caused by an increase of the activity bound
by one unit.

### Equation: EQE_ACTEFF

**Indices**: **region (r), vintage year (v), period (t), process (p),
commodity group (cg), side (io), timeslice (s)**

**Type**: =

**Related variables**: **VAR_ACT, VAR_FLO**

**Related equations**: **EQ_PTRANS, EQ_ACTPL**

**Purpose**: This equation is generated when the process activity
efficiency has been defined with the input attribute
*ACT_EFF~r,v,p,cg,s~* for a group of flows on the shadow side.

**Remarks**:

-   The group cg in the equation may be either directly specified in
    > ACT_EFF, or, if *ACT_EFF* is only specified for single commodity,
    > determined as the commodity type, or, if *ACT_EFF* is specified
    > for the reserved group name \'ACT\', determined as the default
    > shadow group of the process.

-   The parameter *ACT_EFF~r,v,p,cg,s~* can be specified using any of
    > the following as the cg:

-   commodity groups; these define a common efficiency for all member
    > commodities in the group that are on the shadow side of the
    > process;

-   commodity types (NRG/MAT/ENV/DEM/FIN); as above, these define a
    > common efficiency for all member commodities in the group that are
    > on the shadow side of the process;

-   the predefined commodity group \'ACT\'; this defines a common
    > efficiency for all members of the default shadow group of the
    > process;

-   single commodities on the shadow side without an associated group
    > efficiency; these define commodity-specific efficiencies, and the
    > shadow group will consist of all commodities of the same type; if
    > no commodity efficiency is defined for some member in the group,
    > the default efficiency 1 is assumed;

-   single commodities on the shadow side with an associated group
    > efficiency; these define commodity-specific efficiencies as above,
    > but are multiplied by the effi­ciency specified for the group; if
    > no efficiency is defined for some member in the group, the group
    > efficiency is applied directly to that member;

-   single commodities C that are members of the PCG of the process;
    > these define commodity-specific multipliers for the process
    > efficiency when producing the commodity C; if no efficiencies are
    > additionally defined on the shadow side of the process, the whole
    > standard shadow group of the process is assumed to be involved in
    > the transformation (as when using 'ACT'), with the default
    > efficiency of 1 on the shadow side.

-   The ACT_EFF parameter can also be shaped by using a FLO_FUNCX
    > parameter of the following form:
    > FLO_FUNCX(reg,datayear,p,CG,\'ACT\') = shape index. Here, the CG
    > should correspond to the group of commodities on the shadow side
    > involved in the EQE_ACTEFF equation (the group, commodity type, or
    > \'ACT\' that was either explicitly or implicitly used in the
    > ACT_EFF parameters that should be shaped).

### Equation: EQ_ACTFLO 

**Indice**s: **region (r), vintage year (v), milestone year (t), process
(p), time slice (s)**

**Type**: =

**Related variables**: **VAR_ACT, VAR_FLO, VAR_IRE**

**Related equations**: **EQ_COMBAL, EQ_CAPACT, EQ_PTRANS**

**Purpose**: This equation defines the VAR_ACT activity variable in
terms of the "primary flows" of a process. The primary flows are defined
by the user through the **prc_actunt** set attribute.

**Remarks**:

-   The internal set **rtp_vintyr** ensures that (v,t) expressions are
    generated for the vintaged processes and (t,t) for the non-vintaged
    ones.

-   The constraint defines the activity of a process. The activity of a
    process is limited in the equation EQ(l)\_CAPACT by the available
    capacity.

-   **rtp_vara(r,t,p)** controls the valid periods in which the process
    can operate.

-   **rp_aire(r,p)** controls which sides of an import/export process
    should define activity

-   If the activity of a process is defined by a single flow, the flow
    variable is replaced by the activity variable in case that the
    reduction algorithm is activated. Then, in all equations where the
    flow occurs, the activity variable is used instead. In this case the
    equation EQ_ACTFLO is not generated.

**Equation:**

### Equation: EQ_ACTPL

**Indice**s: **region (r), vintage year (v), period (t), process (p),
time slice (s)**

**Type**: =

**Related variables**: **VAR_ACT, VAR_UPS**

**Related equations**: **EQE_ACTEFF**

**Purpose**: This equation defines the variable proportional to the
efficiency loss under partial loads, if endogenous partial load
efficiencies are modeled for a process, or a corresponding cost penalty
under partial loads.

**Remarks:**

-   Endogenous partial load efficiencies can only be modeled for
    > processes that have their efficiency modelled by the ACT_EFF
    > parameter.

-   The input parameter ACT_LOSPL(r,y,p,\'FX\') defines the proportional
    > increase in specific fuel consumption at the minimum operating
    > level, when modelling partial load efficiencies endogenously (for
    > process p, vintage y, region r).

-   The input parameter ACT_LOSPL(r,y,p,\'LO\') defines the minimum
    > operating level used for the partial load efficiency function;
    > default value is taken from ACT_UPS(r,y,p, \'ANNUAL\',\'FX\'), but
    > if neither is specified, is set to 0.1.

-   The input parameter ACT_LOSPL(r,y,p,\'UP\') defines the fraction of
    > the feasible load range above the minimum operating level, below
    > which the efficiency losses are assumed to occur; default value =
    > 0.6.

-   It is recommended that the minimum operating level is defined by the
    > ACT_MINLD(r,v,p) parameter, which is then used as the default
    > value for ACT_LOSPL(r,y,p,\'LO\'). However, if desired, the

### Equation: EQ_ACTRAMP

**Indice**s: **region (r), vintage year (v), period (t), process (p),
time slice (s), bound (bd)**

**Type**: =

**Related variables**: **VAR_ACT, VAR_NCAP, VAR_UPS**

**Related equations**: **EQE_CAPLOAD**

**Purpose**: This equation defines maximum ramp-up and ramp-down rates
for a standard process. The maximum ramp-rates are specified with the
input parameter *ACT_UPS*(r,v,p,s,\'UP\') and *ACT_UPS*(r,v,p,s,\'LO\'),
as fractions of the nominal on-line capacity per hour.

**Remarks:**

-   The amount of on-line capacity is the full available capacity,
    > unless start-ups / shut-downs have been enabled by using the
    > parameter *ACT_MINLD*.

**Notation:**

-   *SUP(s)* is the set of timeslices above timeslice ***s*** in the
    timeslice tree, but including also ***s*** itself

### Equation: EQ_ACTRAMPC 

**Indice**s: **region (r), vintage year (v), period (t), process (p),
time slice (s)**

**Type**: =

**Related variables**: **VAR_ACT, VAR_UPS, VAR_UDP**

**Related equations**: **EQE_CAPLOAD**

**Purpose**: The increase or decrease in output load of a process may
result in ramping costs per unit of load (i.e. unit of capacity). The
costs are directly applied to the differences in the load level between
successive time slices during the dispatching phase and at the process
operating level. This equation defines the changes in loads by ramping
up or down in the dispatching phase, for which ramping costs are to be
applied. The ramping costs are specified with the input parameter
*ACT_CSTRMP*(r,v,p,bd,cur), per unit of load change between successive
timeslices.

**Remarks:**

-   The amount of on-line capacity is the full available capacity,
    > unless start-ups / shut-downs have been enabled by using the
    > parameter *ACT_MINLD*.

The following equation calculates the changes in the load
![](media/image131.png)![](media/image131.png) during the dispatching
phase:

![](media/image132.wmf)

In the above equation the variable *var_ldc~r,v,t,p,s,LO~* holds load
decreases, while the variable *var_ldc~r,v,t,p,s,UP~* holds load
increases. The two variables appear together in the equation since at
each time slice ![](media/image133.png)![](media/image133.png) only one
of the two variables can be set (i.e. the load can either increase or
decrease).

Having calculated the changes in the dispatchable load, the associated
ramping costs are entered into the objective function as the sum of the
load changes *var_ldc~r,v,t,p,s,UP~* multiplied by the cost attribute
*ACT_CSTRMP~r,v,p,UP,cur~* for the ramping up costs, and the sum of the
load changes *var_ldc~r,v,t,p,s,LO~* multiplied by the cost attribute
*ACT_CSTRMP~r,v,p,LO,cur~* for the ramping down costs. The costs are
discounted to the base year:

### Equation: EQL_ACTUPC

**Indices**: **region (r), vintage year (v), period (t), process (p),
timeslice level (tsl), lim_type (l), time slice (s)**

**Type**: ≤

**Related variables**: **VAR_UPS, VAR_NCAP, VAR_RCAP**

**Related equations**: **EQE_ACTUPS, EQ_CAPLOAD**

**Purpose**: This equation has two purposes, according to the lim_type
(l):

1.  It defines a lower limit for consecutive on-line / off-line hours of
    process capacity, such that capacity started-up cannot be
    immediately shut down again, or capacity shut-down cannot be
    immediately started up again. This purpose is served when
    lim_type=LO/UP.

2.  It defines a maximum number of start-up cycles for the process
    capacity within the timeslice cycle under the parent timeslice.

**Remarks:**

-   The minimum on-line / off-line hours are defined by using the input
    attribute *ACT_TIME~r,v,p,bd~*, where bd = LO/UP. The maximum number
    of start-up cycles is defined by using the input attribute
    *ACT_TIME~r,v,p,\'N\'~*.

**Notation:**

-   *SUP(s)* is the set of timeslices above timeslice ***s*** in the
    timeslice tree, but including also ***s*** itself,

-   *UPS(p)* is the set of timeslices with start-ups/shut-downs allowed
    for process *p*,

-   *P(s)* and *C(s)* refer to the parent timeslice of ***s*** and the
    set of child timeslices of ***s***, respectively.

**Type**: =

**Related variables**: **VAR_UPS**

**Related equations**: **EQL_ACTUPS, EQ_CAPLOAD**

**Purpose**: This equation establishes the relation between
start-ups/shut-downs and the change in the amount of on-line capacity
between successive timeslices. It is generated only when start-up costs
have been defined for a standard process with *ACT_CSTUP*.

**Notation:**

**Type**: ≤

**Related variables**: **VAR_UPS**

**Related equations**: **EQE_ACTUPS, EQ_CAPLOAD**

**Purpose**: This equation ensures that startup costs are being
consistently applied when start-up costs have been defined on multiple
timeslice levels.

**Notation:**

-   *UPS^+^(r,p,tsl)* is the set of timeslice levels with
    start-ups/shut-down costs defined for process **p**.

###  Equation: EQ(*l*)\_ASHAR

**Indices**: **region (r), vintage year (v), period (t), process (p),
time slice (s)**

**Type**: As determined by the bd index of the input parameter FLO_SHAR:

-   *l* = \'G\' for **bd** = \'LO\' yields ≥,

-   *l* = \'L\' for **bd** = \'UP\' yields ≤,

-   *l* = \'E\' for **bd** = \'FX\' yields =.

**Related variables**: **VAR_FLO, VAR_ACT, VAR_SOUT**

**Related equations**: **EQ(*l*)\_INSHR, EQ(*l*)\_OUTSHR**

**Purpose**: A share equation between process flows/activity is
generated a process (**p**) in region (**r**) for time period (**t**)
and each time-slice (**s**). The equation is similar to the equations
EQ(l)\_INSHR and EQ(l)\_OUTSHR, but is only generated when the input
parameter *FLO_SHAR~r,v,p,c,cg,s,bd~* is specified in a non-standard
way, for a commodity **c** and group **cg** such that **c** is not a
member of group **cg**, or such that **c**=**cg**.

**Remarks**:

-   Internally, the non-standard *FLO_SHAR*s are converted into the
    > corresponding *FLO_ASHAR* parameters.

-   In general, the constraint is generated on the level of the process
    > flow variable for **c**, unless **c**=\'ACT\', which will result
    > in an annual level constraint.

-   When **c**=\'ACT\', the equation defines a bound on the amount of
    > activity in proportion to the flows in the group **cg**, on the
    > ANNUAL level.

-   When **cg**=\'ACT\', the equation defines a bound on the amount of
    > flow of **c** in proportion to the activity, on the level of the
    > process flow variable for **c**.

-   When **c**=**cg**, and **c** is a member of the default shadow
    > group, the share equation is generated for the flow of **c** in
    > the total flow of commodities in the SPG, and either on the group
    > level or on the WEEKLY level, whichever is higher. This feature
    > makes it easy to define e.g. daily share constraints for a DAYNITE
    > level process, such as fuel shares for plug-in hybrid cars.

-   When the process is a storage process, the only valid share
    > specification is *FLO_SHAR~r,v,p,c,\'ACT\',s,bd~*, where c is the
    > discharge commodity of a timeslice storage. This generates a
    > constraint between the output flow and the storage activity, which
    > can be useful e.g. for preventing the use of the storage for a
    > by-pass operation. The **cg** is set automatically to the SPG when
    > the *FLO_SHAR* is converted into *FLO_ASHAR.*

### Equation: EQ(*l*)\_BLND

**Indices**: **region (r), year (t), refinery product (ble),
specification (spe)**

**Type**: Any type, as determined by the value of the input parameter
BL_TYPE(r,ble,spe):

-   *l* = 'L' for a value of 1 yields ![](media/image120.wmf).

-   *l* = 'G' for a value of 2 yields ![](media/image150.emf).

-   *l* = 'E' for a value of 3 yields ![](media/image119.wmf).

**Related variables**: **VAR_BLND**

**Related equations**: **EQ_COMBAL**

**Purpose**: The blending equations ensure that the characteristics of
petroleum products (e.g. sulfur content, density, octane number, etc.)
lie within specified limits, if desired.

**Remarks**:

-   Parameter BL_COM contains the values of the blending specifications
    **spe** for the blending streams **opr**.

-   Parameter BL_SPEC contains the value of the specification **spe** of
    the blending product **ble**.

-   The blending variables VAR_BLND are expressed in volume units. If
    the characteristics of the blending streams **opr** and the product
    **ble** are not given in volume units (indicated by input parameter
    REFUNIT), the user has to provide a conversion parameter CONVERT
    which contains the density and energy content (by weight or by
    volume) of each blending stream. The conversion parameters are used
    to derive the coefficients RU_CVT of the blending streams in the
    blending equation.

### Equation: EQ_BNDCST

**Indices**: **region (r), year1 (y1), period (t), year2 (y2), cost
aggregation (costagg),\
currency (cur)**

**Type**: =

**Related variables**: **VAR_CUMCST**

**Related equations**: **EQ_OBJ**

**Purpose**: This equation is generated when a bound is specified on
regional costs, taxes and/or subsidies, either cumulative over a year
range (using *REG_CUMCST~r,y1,y2,agg,,cur,bd~*) or in given milestone
years (using *REG_BNDCST~r,y,agg,cur,bd~*). It sets the level of the
variable *VAR_CUMCST~r,y1,y2,costagg,cur~* equal to the cost expression,
to be bounded accordingly.

**Remarks**:

-   The available cost aggergations that can be bounded are listed in
    the table below.

-   All the cost components related to investments are expressed in
    terms of annualized capital costs, i.e. as annuities paid in the
    year(s) in question. These components thus include interest during
    both construction and payback time.

-   In all combined cost aggregations, subsidies are treated as negative
    costs when summed up with other cost/taxes, but when bounded alone
    they are treated as positive.

### Equation: EQ(*l*)\_BNDNET/PRD

**Indices: region (r), period (t), commodity (c), timeslice (s)**

**Type**: Any type, as determined by the bound index **bd** of
COM_BNDNET/PRD:

-   *l* = 'G' for **bd** = 'LO' (lower bound) yields
    ![](media/image118.wmf).

-   *l* = 'E' for **bd** = 'FX' (fixed bound) yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

-   *l* = 'L' for **bd** = 'UP' (upper bound) yields
    ![](media/image120.wmf).

**Purpose:** If the bound on the net or gross production of a commodity
is specified for a timeslice being above the timeslice level of the
commodity, the equation described here is generated. The bound on the
net or gross production of a commodity is directly applied to the
variable (VAR_COMNET, VAR_COMPRD), if the bound parameter is specified
for a commodity timeslice (**com_ts**).

**Remarks:**

-   The internal set **rcs_comts** used in the equation contains all
    timeslices at or above the timeslice level being defined for the
    commodity.

-   The internal set **rtcs_varc** used in the summation part of the
    equation contains all timeslices (out of **com_ts**) and periods for
    which the commodity is available.

-   The internal set **ts_map(r,s,ts)** used in the summation part of
    the equation contains for a given timeslice (**s**) all timeslices
    (**ts**) being at or below **s** in the timeslice tree.

**Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: Value of the net production of a commodity (production minus
consumption)

Dual: marginal cost of increasing the bound by one unit

**Type**: As determined by the bd index of the standard availability
parameter:

-   *l* = 'L' for **bd** = 'UP' yields ![](media/image120.wmf),

-   *l* = 'E' for **bd** = 'FX' yields ![](media/image119.wmf).

**Related variables**: **VAR_NCAP, VAR_FLO, VAR_IRE, VAR_SIN, VAR_SOUT**

**Related equations**: **EQ(*l*)\_CAPACT, EQL_CAPFLO**

**Purpose**: This equation relates the flows in the primary group of a
process to its available existing capacity in period **t**. The existing
capacity consists of investments made in the current and previous
periods (VAR_NCAP) and investment decisions that have been made
exogenously (*NCAP_PASTI/PRC_RESID*). The availability of the existing
capacity in a specific period **t** and timeslice **s** can be specified
by the input attribute *NCAP_AFC~r,v,p,cg,tsl~ / NCAP_AFCS~r,v,p,cg,s~*,
where cg can be a single commodity in the PG, thereby making the process
availability factor dependent on the output mix.

**Remarks:**

-   The cg index in the input attributes *NCAP_AFC~r,v,p,cg,tsl~ /
    NCAP_AFCS~r,v,p,cg,s~* can be either a single commodity in the PG,
    the reserved group name \'ACT\' denoting the PG itself (for other
    than storage processes, see below), or a commodity type of the PG.
    Any *NCAP_AFCS~r,v,p,cg,s~* specified overrides an
    *NCAP_AFC~r,v,p,cg,tsl~* specified on the same level, and any value
    specified for a single commodity overrides a value specified for a
    group containing the commodity.

-   For storage and trade processes, which both can have the same
    commodity IN and OUT of the process, defining an
    *NCAP_AFC/NCAP_AFCS* both for the commodity type and for the single
    commodity itself results in the commodity availability being applied
    to the output flow while the group availability is applied to the
    input flow.

-   For storage processes, defining an *NCAP_AFC/NCAP_AFCS* on the
    reserved group name \'ACT\' defines a separate availability factor
    constraint (EQL_CAPFLO) for the storage level, and not for the flows
    in the PG.

-   For trade processes, **prc_map~r,\'DISTR\',p~** can be also used for
    removing exports from contributing to the availability equation, if
    the process is bi-directional.

NCAP_AFA:

-   *l* = 'E' for **bd** = 'FX' (fixed bound) yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

-   *l* = 'L' for **bd** = 'UP' (upper bound) yields ≤.

-   *l* = 'G' for **bd** = 'LO' (lower bound) yields ≥.

**Related variables:** **VAR_ACT, VAR_NCAP, VAR_FLO**

**Related equations:** **EQ_ACTFLO, EQ_COMBAL, EQ_INSHR, EQ_OUTSHR,
EQ_PTRANS**

**Purpose**: The capacity-activity equation relates the activity of a
process to its available existing capacity in period **t**. The existing
capacity consists of investments made in the current and previous
periods (VAR_NCAP) and investment decisions that have been made
exogenously (NCAP_PASTI/PRC_RESID). The availability of the existing
capacity in a specific period **t** and timeslice **s** is specified by
the availability factor. Three availability factors exist:

-   NCAP_AF(r,v,p,s,bd):

> Availability factor specified for a specific period and timeslice. If
> this availability factor is not specified for the process timeslices
> (**prc_ts**), the availabilities are aggregated/inherited according to
> the timeslice tree. Thus, for a process operating on the DAYNITE level
> it is sufficient to specify only one availability for the ANNUAL
> timeslice, which is then inherited to the DAYNITE timeslices.

-   NCAP_AFS(r,v,p,s,bd):

> Availability factor specified for a specific period and timeslice. In
> contrast to NCAP_AF, this availability is not inherited/aggregated
> along the timeslice tree. If this availability is specified for a
> seasonal timeslice for a process operating on the DAYNITE level, the
> capacity-activity constraint is generated for the seasonal timeslice
> and sums over the DAYNITE activities. This gives the process
> flexibility how to operate within the seasonal timeslice as long as
> the overall seasonal availability restriction is fulfilled.

-   NCAP_AFA(r,v,p,bd):

> Annual availability factor similar to NCAP_AFS being specified for the
> ANNUAL timeslice with the difference that NCAP_AFA is always applied
> in such a way as if the process is non-vintage dependent, even if it
> is specified as a vintaged one (**prc_vint**). Thus the annual
> availability factor is especially useful to calibrate the activity of
> a process in the first period(s) to the statistics irrespectively of
> its vintage structure and the vintage dependent activities (NCAP_AFS),
> which can be specified in addition to NCAP_AFA.

If the process is defined as a vintaged one (**prc_vint**), for each
vintage year (**v**) of the existing capacity stock in period (**t**) a
separate capacity-activity constraint will be generated (exception
NCAP_AFA), while for a non-vintaged process one capacity-activity
constraint is generated that sums over all vintage years. In the latter
case the vintage index of the equation (EQ(l)\_CAPACT(r,v,t,p,s)) always
equals the period index (**v** = **t**).

**Remarks:**

-   For all process timeslices (**prc_ts**), NCAP_AF(r,t,p,s,'UP') is by
    default set to 1, unless NCAP_AF('UP') or NCAP_AF('FX') has been
    specified by the user. Thus, it is ensured that the activity of a
    process can never exceed its capacity. If for example only NCAP_AFA
    is specified by the modeler as annual availability for a process
    with a DAYNITE timeslice resolution, in addition to the annual
    activity-capacity constraint activity-capacity constraints with an
    availability of 100% are generated for the DAYNITE process
    timeslices.

-   An average value of the availability factors (NCAP_AF/S) over the
    years in the period is used when an age-dependent 'Shape' is
    specified for them.

-   **rtp_cptyr** identifies the capacities installed in period **v**
    still available in period **t**. This set takes into account that
    investments may be turned-off for certain periods (by PRC_NOFF). The
    condition is as under:

> **v,t such that**
>
> B(v) ≥ B(t) -- (COEF_RPTI\*TLIFE) -- ILED + 1
>
> *and*
>
> B(v) ≤ E(t) -- ILED

-   **prc_vint** is a set of processes for which attributes are changing
    over time and vintaging is required.

-   Entries in **rtp_vintyr** are controlled by the same logic as
    applied to COEF_CPT combined with the vintaging consideration. Note
    **v** = **t** when no vintaging is required, or vintaging is turned
    off for a particular processes, where the sum over the previous
    investments is used instead of individual variables.

-   COEF_AF~r,v,t,p,s,bd~ will be read off a pre-processed table, after
    application of SHAPE and MULTI to the user provided availabilities
    (NCAP_AF/A/S).

-   COEF_AF is calculated in the following manner:

1)  aggregate if possible (pp_lvlbd.mod), otherwise inherit (in
    > ppmain.mod)

2)  apply SHAPE and MULTI to NCAP_AF/S

-   For storage processes, the capacity describes the volume of the
    storage and the activity the storage content. For storage processes
    between timeslices (**prc_tgtss**, **prc_nstts**) parameter
    RS_STGPRD is used instead of G_YRFR. RS_STGPRD(r,s) equals the
    number of storage periods on the timeslice level of timeslice **s**
    in the whole year multiplied with the duration of its parent
    timeslice **ts**. Thus, the storage level VAR_ACT (and indirectly
    the storage in- and output flows VAR_SIN and VAR_SOUT) are scaled-up
    for the entire year.

> Consequently, the value of RS_STGPRD(r,s) is:

-   1 for a seasonal storage,

-   365/7\*G_YRFR(r,ts) for a weekly storage, where **ts** is the parent
    node of **s**,

-   365\*G_YRFR(r,ts) for a daynite storage, where **ts** is the parent
    node of **s**.

**\
Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: In case of an inequality constraint and no past investments
(i.e. RHS is zero), the primal value describes the difference between
the activity level and the maximum possible activity due to the
installed capacity in the considered period and timeslice. If the primal
value is negative, it means that the capacity is not fully utilized. In
case of past investments, the RHS is not zero[^43], but has a positive
value and corresponds to the possible activity due to the past
investments. If the primal value equals the RHS value, the capacity is
fully utilized. If not the difference (RHS minus primal value), where
the primal value may also be negative, describes the possible unused
activity production.

Dual: The dual value is in case of an inequality constraint a negative
number, when the constraint is binding. It describes the cost reduction
caused by an additional capacity unit and can thus be interpreted as the
value of the capacity. For a power plant for example it can be viewed as
the part of the electricity price that can be used for covering the
fixed operating and investment costs of the capacity (multiplied by the
corresponding coefficient in the dual equation of the electricity flow
variable). If NCAP_AFS or NCAP_AFA are applied for timeslices above the
process timeslice level, in addition capacity-activity constraints (with
a default value for NCAP_AF of 1 as upper bound) are generated for the
process timeslices. The dual value of the constraints related to
NCAP_AFS or NCAP_AFA serve as benchmark value of the capacity between
the process timeslices. If for example NCAP_AFA is given for a power
plant with a DAYNITE timeslice resolution (e.g. WD, WN, SD, SN), the
NCAP_AF related capacity constraints with an availability of 1 are
usually binding only in one process timeslice level, e.g. WD. Now the
dual variable of NCAP_AFA can be seen as rent that must be covered in
other process timeslices (WN, SD, SN) by the then prevailing electricity
price, so that the model would decide to shift the scarce annual
capacity from WD to another timeslice.

**Type**: ≤

**Related variables**: **VAR_NCAP, VAR_SCAP, VAR_FLO, VAR_ACT, VAR_UPS**

**Related equations**: **EQ(*l*)\_CAFLAC**

**Purpose**: The equation defines a maximum level for a process flow
(standard processes) or activity (only for storage processes) in
relation to its capacity, according to an *NCAP_AFC/NCAP_AFCS* parameter
specified by the user.

**Remarks:**

-   The equation is generated only for process flows not in the PG, as
    > the PG flows are handled by EQ_CAFLAC. However, independent
    > EQL_CAPFLO constraints may be requested also for the PG flows by

### Equation: EQ_CAPLOAD

**Indices**: **region (r), vintage year (v), period (t), process (p),
time slice (s), lim_type (l)**

**Type**: ≤

**Related variables**: **VAR_ACT, VAR_NCAP, VAR_UPS**

**Related equations**: **EQE_ACTUPS**

**Purpose**: This equation is used as a replacement for the standard
EQ(l)\_CAPACT equations for the process timeslices, whenever flexible
minimum operating limits are defined for a standard process. It defines
the maximum and minimum levels of activity in relation to the available
capacity, taking also into account capacity that may have been shut-down
during some timeslices. The difference to the standard EQ(l)\_CAPACT
equations is thus that EQ_CAPLOAD refers to the on-line capacity in each
timeslice, while EQ(l)\_CAPACT refers to the full available capacity.

**Remarks:**

-   The flexible minimum operating limits are defined with the parameter
    ACT_MINLD(r,y,p). Any fixed lower bound availability factor at the
    process timeslice level is ignored when ACT_MINLD is defined.

-   Star-ups/shut-downs of capacity are by default only allowed on the
    SEASON level, and without costs. More general dispatchability
    features can be activated by defining start-up costs, with the
    parameter ACT_CSTUP. Start-up costs can be optionally defined even
    on the SEASON level, if desired (see the Table below).

-   Start-ups and shut-downs will always occur in pairs, and therefore
    any shut-down costs can be directly included in the ACT_CSTUP
    parameter. If start-ups on some level can be assumed without
    additional costs, it is advisable to leave ACT_CSTUP unspecified at
    that level. If the start-up costs are assumed zero on some timeslice
    level, they must be zero also on any higher levels.

capacity variable used in user constraint):

-   *l* = 'E' for **bd** = 'FX' (fixed bound), or for lower and upper
    capacity bound at the same time, or for learning technology or for
    capacity variable used in user constraint yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

-   *l* = 'L' for **bd** = 'UP' (upper bound) yields
    ![](media/image120.wmf), if no lower bound at the same time.

**Related variables:** **VAR_NCAP, VAR_CAP**

**Related equations:** **EQ(*l*)\_CAPACT**

**Purpose:** This equation adds up the investments (VAR_NCAP), which
have been made in the current and previous periods and still exist in
the current period, and past investments being made before the beginning
of the model horizon and either assigns it to the capacity variable
VAR_CAP or applies directly lower or upper capacity bounds to it.

**Remarks:**

-   It is generated only for those milestone year & process combinations
    that have a corresponding CAP_BND specification, for processes where
    there is a user constraint involving a capacity variable, and for
    processes being a learning technology (**teg**).

-   In case that only a lower or an upper capacity bound is specified,
    the capacity bounds are directly used as RHS constants. In the other
    cases, the capacity variable is used instead.

-   The set **rtp_varp(r,t,p)** describes the cases where a capacity
    variable is needed:

-   Capacity variable is used in a user constraint,

-   Lower and upper capacity bound are specified for the same period. In
    > this case it is more efficient to generate one capacity variable
    > by one EQE_CPT equation and bound the variable instead of
    > generating the two equations EQL_CPT and EQG_CPT.

    > (**com_tmap**(r,c,'NRG')), demands (**com_tmap**(r,c,'DEM')), and

    > greater or equal consumption if no upper bound at the same time

-   *l* = 'E' (**lim** = 'FX' in **com_lim**) for materials
    > (**com_tmap**(r,c,'MAT')) and financial commodities
    > (**com_tmap**(r,c,'FIN')); yields = type of equation; production
    > has to be equal consumption if no upper bound at the same time

**Related variables:** **VAR_ACT, VAR_FLO, VAR_COMNET, VAR_COMPRD,
VAR_IRE, VAR_NCAP, VAR_SIN/OUT, VAR_BLND, VAR_ELAST**

**Purpose:** This equation ensures that at each period and time-slice,
the total procurement of a commodity balances its total disposition. A
commodity may be procured in several different ways: imported, produced
by technologies (activity and capacity based), released at retirement of
some investments. A commodity may be disposed of in several other ways:
exported, consumed by technologies (activity or capacity based) or by a
demand, or "sunk" at investment time of a process. The default type for
the balance constraint of an energy carrier and for an emission is ≥,
which allows procurement to exceed disposition. This may be important in
order to avoid some infeasibilities dues to rigid processes with many
outputs or inputs. The default sign is = for materials. Both defaults
may be modified by the user by the set **com_lim**.

**Remarks:**

-   The commodity balance is generated for the timeslices (**s**)
    according to the user defined sets **com_tsl** or **com_ts**.

-   When there are one or more of the attributes BND/CST/SUB/TAX/CUM
    relating to production of the commodity, EQE_COMPRD is generated in
    addition to this equation. EQE_COMPRD simply creates a new variable
    (VAR_COMPRD) equal to the production part of the LHS of the balance
    constraint (see expression COMSUP below)

-   Similarly, if there are relevant coefficients for the net production
    of the commodity, the expression VAR_COMNET is created, containing
    the net production, and used in the RHS (see below).

-   Note that CAL_FLOFLO(r,t,p,c,s,io) table stores the complete
    expressions (***coefficients and variables***) giving the flow of
    each commodity.

-   The investment related input flows are assumed to be spread
    uniformly throughout the commodity lead-time, NCAP_CLED, ending
    exactly at the end of NCAP_ILED (default value for NCAP_CLED is
    NCAP_ILED).

-   Commodity output flows related to dismantling are assumed to occur
    uniformly over NCAP_DLIFE, and to start right after NCAP_DLAG
    (default value: NCAP_DLIFE =1).

-   Net/gross production of other commodities can be aggregated to the
    production side of the commodity balance by using the COM_AGG
    attribute.

-   Capacity-related input/output flows can be defined with NCAP_COM,
    which has the \'io\' index. Examples exist for (physical)
    consumption as well as release, land use by hydro dams and methane
    emissions from them, respectively.

EQ_COMBAL reads schematically as follows:

*Procurement -- Disposition {*≥ or = *} COEF_FBRHS*

where COEF_FBRHS is 0 for all balance equations, except for demand
balances where it is equal to a positive parameter. In addition,
COEF_FBRHS is equal to a variable when the equation is used to define
the variables VAR_COMPRD or VAR_COMNET.

This is expressed mathematically as the following equation, whose
coefficients will be further developed in what follows.

**Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: In case of an inequality constraint of the commodity balance,
the primal value corresponds to the value which is obtained when all
terms with variables are moved to the LHS of the equation and all
constants, e.g. terms with the demand parameter COM_PROJ, are moved to
the RHS side. The primal value equals the value of the LHS side. Thus,
the commodity balance is binding when its primal value equals its RHS
constant, it is non-binding, i.e., production exceeds consumption if the
primal value is greater than the RHS constant[^44].

Dual: The dual variable (shadow price) of the commodity balance
describes the internal value of the commodity. If the commodity balance
is binding, i.e., consumption equals production, the shadow price
describes the cost change in the objective function induced by an
increase of the commodity demand by one unit. Since the LHS of the
commodity balance describes the difference between production and
consumption, this additional demand may be covered by an increase in
production or by a decrease in consumption. In the first case the shadow
price is determined by activities on the supply side of the commodity,
while in the latter case saving measures on the demand side of the
commodity are setting the shadow price. Note that when a peaking
constraint (EQ_PEAK) for the considered commodity exists, the price
consumers must pay during peak hours depends not only on the shadow
price of the commodity balance but also on the shadow of the peaking
constraint (if the flow variable of the consuming technology has the
same timeslice resolution as the commodity and the peaking parameters
COM_PKFLX=0 and FLO_PKCOI=1, the price to consumers is simply the sum of
the two shadow prices; in other cases the dual constraint of the flow
variable should be inspected to identify the correct coefficients for
the two shadow prices).

**Flow Coefficients related to process activity (VAR_FLO)**

![](media/image173.wmf)

with RTCS_TSFR defined in the following way:

![](media/image174.wmf)

The parameter RTCS_TSFR is used to match the timeslice resolution of
flow variables (VAR_FLO/VAR_IRE) and commodities. RTCS_TSFR is the
coefficient of the flow variable, which is producing or consuming
commodity (**c**), in the commodity balance of **c**. If timeslice **s**
corresponds to the commodity timeslice resolution of **c** and timeslice
**s1** to the timeslice resolution of the flow variable two cases may
occur:

1\) The flow variables are on a finer timeslice level than the commodity
balance (first case in the formula above, **ts_map**(r,s,s1) is true):
in this case the flow variables with timeslices **s** being below ts in
the timeslice tree are summed to give the aggregated flow within
timeslice **s1**. RTCS_TSFR has the value 1.

2\) The flow variables are on coarser timeslice level than the commodity
balance: in this case the flow variable is split-up on the finer
timeslice level of the commodity balance according to the ratio of the
timeslice duration of **s** to **s1**: RTCS_TSFR has the value =
COM_FR(r,s) / COM_FR(r,s1) for demand commodities and G_YRFR(r,s) /
G_YRFR(r,s1) otherwise. When COM_FR is used, the demand load curve is
moved to the demand process. Thus, it is possible to model demand
processes on an ANNUAL level and ensure at the same time that the
process follows the given load curve COM_FR.

capacity based) + investment-time outflow + dismantling related
outflows, in each period and time slice. Note that this excludes demand
reduction (in the case of a demand commodity).

*FLO_CUM~r,p,c,y1,y2~* or *ACT_CUM~r,p,y1,y2~* has been specified, for
bounding the cumulative amount of process flow or activity. It is also

**Type**: =

**Related variables**: **VAR_COMNET/VAR_COMPRD, VAR_CUMCOM**

**Related equations**: **EQ(*l*)\_COMBAL, EQE_COMPRD**

**Purpose**: This equation defines a variable representing the
cumulative amount of net release or total gross production of a
commodity, primarily for bounding the variable according to the bound
parameter COM_CUMNET/PRD. The constraint concerns net release/production
over an arbitrary number of consecutive years between the year (y1) and
year (y2) as given in the parameter COM_CUMNET/PRD.

**Remarks**:

-   It is possible to have multiple cumulative bounds of any type.

-   The total time span for calculating the cumulative production need
    > not consist of an exact number of periods.

-   The cumulative bounds are expressed annually only.

-   The sign of the bound is indicated by the **l** equation index.

**Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: The primal value describes the cumulative net release/the
cumulative production of commodity **c** between the years **y1** and
**y2**.

Dual: The dual value of the constraint describes the change in the
objective function if the bound parameter is increased by one unit. The
increase of an upper bound yields a reduction of the total costs (dual
value is negative), since the system wants to use more of this
commodity. The increase of a lower bound yields an increase of the total
costs (dual value is positive), since the system has to be forced to use
more of an uncompetitive commodity (the commodity itself or the
technologies utilizing it maybe too expensive). The dual value of a
cumulative production constraint can also be interpreted as a
tax/subsidy that is applied between the years **y1** and **y2** to reach
the same cumulative productions as specified in the bound (the
tax/subsidy has to be adjusted by the discount rate).

**Indices:** **region (r),** **milestone year (t), process (p)**

**Type: =**

**Related variables: VAR_DNCAP, VAR_SNCAP, VAR_NCAP**

**Related equations: EQ_DSCONE**

**Purpose:** The investment variable of the technology p in period t and
region r can take only specific unit sizes given by the parameter
NCAP_DISC. This equation defines the investment variable to be equal to
the sum over the different unit sizes each multiplied by the
corresponding decision variable VAR_DNCAP. However, the sister equation
EQ_DSCONE restricts this sum to a single term only (i.e. a single unit
-- of a specific size -- is allowed to be invested in at period **t**).
Alternatively, if NCAP_SEMI is defined, the equation defines the
investment variable to be equal to the semi-continuous variable
VAR_SNCAP.

**Remarks**:

-   The set **unit** contains the names of capacity blocks/units that
    can be added, the set contain integer numbers going from '0' to
    '100'. The unit name '0' is used to describe the decision that no
    capacity should be added.

-   The set **prc_dscnap(r,p)** contains the processes **p** (in region
    **r**) for which the discrete capacity formulation should be used

-   The parameter **NCAP_DISC(r,t,p,u)** is the allowed capacity size of
    unit u; e.g. the size of unit '1' could be 50 MW, unit '2' 100 MW
    and unit '3' 500 MW. The size of unit '0' is automatically set to
    zero (EPS). If all unit sizes are taken equal, the formulation
    allows the repeated investment of a basic unit (as many as 100
    times, in integer numbers).

-   The parameter **NCAP_SEMI**(r,t,p) can alternatively be used for
    defining the investment variable VAR_NCAP semi-continuous, with the
    lower bound defined by *NCAP_SEMI*, and upper bound by *NCAP_BND*.
    If *NCAP_BND* is not defined, upper bound is assumed equal to the
    lower bound.

-   VAR_DNCAP(r,t,p,u) is a binary decision variable describing whether
    the capacity unit of technology **p** should be added in period
    **t** or not. Some solvers for mixed-integer problems, as CPLEX or
    XPRESS, allow the definition of variables as so-called SOS1 sets
    (special ordered sets) in order to improve the solution process. An
    SOS1 set is defined as a set of variables of which only one variable
    can take a non-zero value. VAR_DNCAP is currently defined as an SOS1
    variable. Not all solvers support this option, in these cases the
    variable type should be changed to a binary variable in the file
    **mod_vars.dsc**.

variable *VAR_SCAP* to be a multiple of a user-defined block size,
specified by *RCAP_BLK*. The amount of capacity retired early can thus
only take discrete values *n* × *RCAP_BLK, n=0,1,2,3,...*.

**Remarks**:

-   Because the residual capacity can be defined rather freely by
    PRC_RESID, a forced component (*RTFORC*) is added into the
    cumulative retirements for processes having existing capacities
    defined with PRC_RESID, corresponding to the trajectory given by
    PRC_RESID.

-   Because it should always be possible to retire the remaining
    residual capacity in full (regardless of the block size specified),
    that amount is added as a second alternative block size, which can
    only be retired in a multiple of 1.

###  Equation: EQ(*l*)\_FLOBND

**Indices: region (r), period (t), process (p), commodity group (cg),
timeslice (s)**

**Type**: Any type, as determined by the bound index **bd** of FLO_BND:

-   *l* = 'G' for **bd** = 'LO' (lower bound) yields
    ![](media/image118.wmf).

-   *l* = 'E' for **bd** = 'FX' (fixed bound) yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

-   *l* = 'L' for **bd** = 'UP' (upper bound) yields
    ![](media/image120.wmf).

**Purpose**: Bound on the sum of process flows in a given commodity
group (**cg**) for a particular process (**p**) in period (**t**) and
timeslice (**s**).

**Remarks:**

-   The constraint bounds the flows in a specific period (**t**)
    irrespectively of the vintage years of the process capacity.

-   The bound can be defined for a single commodity or a group of
    commodities linked to the process (**p**). In the latter case, a
    commodity group (**cg**) must be defined by the user (through
    **com_gmap**).

-   The constraint is generated if one of the following conditions is
    true:

    -   Process (**p**) is vintaged, or

    -   The sum of several process flows given by the commodity group
        (**cg**), and not only a single process flow, should be bounded,
        or

    -   The timeslice resolution of the flow variables are below the
        timeslice (**s**) of the bound parameter.

> In other cases, the bound can be directly applied to the corresponding
> flow variable, so that no extra equation is needed.

-   The timeslice level (**s**) of the bound must be at or higher than
    the timeslice level of the process flows (**rtpcs_varf**).

-   If *FLO_BND* is defined for a trade process, the constraint bounds
    the sum of imports and exports when **cg** is a single commodity,
    but net imports if **cg** is a true commodity group (i.e. is itself
    not a commodity).

**Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: If the primal value equals the bound parameter, the constraint
is binding.

Dual: The dual value describes for a lower/upper bound the cost
increase/decrease in the objective function, if the bound is increased
by one unit. It may also be interpreted as subsidy/tax needed to reach
the given bound value.

**Notation used in formulation:**

-   *XS~cg,ie~* denotes a sign coefficient for trade flows, such that
    *XS~cg,\'IMP\'~* = 1 for all cg, *XS~c,\'EXP\'~* = 1 for all c, and
    *XS~cg,\'EXP\'~* = --1 for all other (true) cg.

**Equation:**

###  Equation: EQ(*l*)\_FLOFR

**Indices: region (r), period (t), process (p), commodity (c), timeslice
(s)**

**Type**: Any type, as determined by the bound index **bd** of FLO_FR:

-   *l* = 'G' for **bd** = 'LO' (lower bound) yields
    ![](media/image118.wmf).

-   *l* = 'E' for **bd** = 'FX' (fixed bound) yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

-   *l* = 'L' for **bd** = 'UP' (upper bound) yields
    ![](media/image120.wmf).

**Purpose: 1)** Relationship in period (**t**) between the total annual
flow and the flow in a particular timeslice (**s**) for a specific
process (**p**). This is the standard usage of the *FLO_FR* parameter,
which may be used even for defining a full load curve for a process
flow.\
**2**) Relationship in period (**t**) between the the flow level in a
particular flow timeslice (**s**) and the average level under all
timeslices under its parent timeslice for a specific process (**p**).
This variant will only be used when *FLO_FR* is levelized to the flow
timeslices (**rpcs_var**), which is triggered by defining any *FLO_FR*
value for that process flow at the ANNUAL level.

**Remarks:**

The sign of the equation determines whether the flow in a given
timeslice is rigidly (=) or flexibly (≥ ; ≤) linked to the annual flow
(or the parent flow level). The constraint bounds the flows
irrespectively of the vintage years of the process capacity.

**Equation:**

**Case A**: Standard EQ(*l*)\_FLOFR: fraction of flow in total ANNUAL
flow

![](media/image194.wmf)

**Case B**: Levelized EQ(*l*)\_FLOFR: flow level in proportion to
average level under parent

![](media/image195.wmf)

###  Equation: EQ(*l*)\_FLOMRK

**Indices**: **region (r), period (t), process (p), commodity (c),
time-slice (s)**

**Type:** Any type, as determined by the bound index **bd** of
FLO_MARK/PRC_MARK:

-   *l* = 'G' for **bd** = 'LO' (lower bound) yields
    ![](media/image118.wmf).

-   *l* = 'E' for **bd** = 'FX' (fixed bound) yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

-   *l* = 'L' for **bd** = 'UP' (upper bound) yields
    ![](media/image120.wmf).

**Related variables:** **VAR_FLO, VAR_IRE, VAR_SIN/SOUT, VAR_COMPRD**

**Related equations**: **EQ(*l*)\_COMBAL, EQE_COMPRD**

**Purpose**: Relationship to facilitate constraints on the market share
of process (p) in the total production of commodity (c). Indicates that
the flow of commodity (c) from/to process (p) is bounded by the given
fraction of the total production of commodity (c). The time-slice level
of the constraint is that of the commodity (c) when using FLO_MARK, and
ANNUAL when using PRC_MARK. The same given fraction is applied to all
time­slices.

**Variables involved:**

-   **VAR_FLO(r,v,t,p,com,s)** -- the average flow to/from a process
    built in period **v**, during time-slice **s**, during each year of
    period **t**. The variable for an input flow appears on the
    consump­tion side of the balance equation without any coefficients,
    and the variable for an output flow on the production side
    multiplied with the commodity efficiency (COM_IE).

-   **VAR_IRE(r,v,t,p,com,s,ie)** -- the average flow to/from an
    exchange process built in period **v**, during time-slice **s**,
    during each year of period **t**. The export variable appears on the
    consump­tion side of the balance equation without any coefficients,
    and the import variable on the production side multiplied by the
    commodity efficiency (COM_IE).

-   **VAR_SIN/SOUT(r,v,t,p,c,s)** -- flows entering/leaving a storage
    process **p** storing a com­modity **c**. The variable for charging
    appears on the consumption side of the balance equation without any
    coefficients; the import variable on the production side multiplied
    by both the storage efficiency and commodity efficiency (SGT_EFF,
    COM_IE).

-   **VAR_COMPRD(r,t,com,s)** -- variable equal to the total import +
    production (activity and capacity based) in each period and time
    slice. This balance is defined by the equation EQE_COMPRD, which is
    automatically generated for all commodities used in the FLO_MARK or
    PRC_MARK parameters.

**Parameters:**

-   **FLO_MARK(r,t,p,c,l)** -- Market share of single process in total
    production of commodity **c**.

-   **PRC_MARK(r,t,p,grp,c,l)** -- Market share of a group **grp** of
    processes in total production of commodity **c**.

**Remarks:**

1.  All the FLO_MARK parameters are internally converted to PRC_MARK
    parameters by the model generator, using the process name of the
    FLO_MARK parameter as the process group index (**grp**) in PRC_MARK.
    Therefore, below references to the parameters are mostly given in
    terms of PRC_MARK only.

2.  Market-share constraints can be specified for standard processes, as
    well as for exchange and storage processes. For standard processes,
    the PRC_MARK parameter value can be unambiguously applied to the
    process flow, and the value should normally be non-negative.
    However, because exchange and storage processes may have both input
    and output flows of the same commodity, for these processes the sign
    of the parameter value determines whether it is applied to the input
    or output flow, by using the following simple conventional rules:

    -   Value ≥ 0: Constraint is applied to the output flow (imports or
        storage discharge)

    -   Value ≤ 0: Constraint is applied to the negative of input flow
        (exports or storage charge)

    -   Value=EPS: Constraint is applied to the net output flow
        (output--input flow)

> These simple rules provide reasonable flexibility for specifying
> market share bounds also for exchange and storage processes, in
> addition to ordinary processes. Although these rules preclude
> individually bounding the input or output flow to zero, this could
> always be accomplished by using the IRE_BND, STG_OUTBND, and STG_INBND
> parameters when necessary.

3.  The default timeslice level of the constraint is the commodity
    timeslice level for the constraints defined by using FLO_MARK by the
    user, and ANNUAL level for those defined by using the PRC_MARK
    parameter. For overriding the default, see remark 4 below.

4.  The commodity used in the parameter does not actually need to be in
    the topology, but it should contain some commodity that does exist
    in the process topology. This feature can be utilized for defining
    market-share equations at any desired timeslice level. For example,
    if ELC is a DAYNITE level commodity, the user could define a dummy
    com­modity ELC_ANN that includes ELC as a group member (through
    COM_GMAP membership), and use the ELC_ANN commodity in the PRC_MARK
    parameter instead of ELC. The constraint would then be defined at
    the timeslice level of the ELC_ANN commodity, which is ANNUAL if not
    explicitly defined.

5.  In the equation formulation below, the set **mrk_ts~r,grp,c,s~**
    denotes the timeslices assigned to the constraints associated with
    group **grp** and commodity **c** in region **r**, as explained in
    remarks 3 and 4 above.

6.  Zero market shares are either removed (for bound type \'LO\') or
    converted into flow bounds (bound types \'UP\' and \'FX\'), because
    the formulation employs inverse values.

**Examples:**

-   Define an upper market share bound of 5% for technology WIND1 in
    total ELC production in the 2010 period.

-   Define an upper market share of 25% for diesel export (through
    exchange process DSLXHG) of total DSL production in the 2010 period.
    Note that because the bound is for exports, in this case the
    parameter value should be negative and the bound type LO instead of
    UP.

PARAMETER FLO_MARK /

REG.2010.WIND1.ELC.UP 0.05

REG.2010.DSLXHG.DSL.LO --0.25

/;

**Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: If the primal value is zero, the constraint is binding. If the
primal value is positive for a lower PRC_MARK bound or negative for an
upper bound, the constraint is non-binding.

Dual: The dual value describes for example for a lower bound, the
subsidy needed to guarantee the market share of the technology being
forced into the market. The subsidy is needed, since the production of
the technology is too expensive compared to other competing
technologies. The value of the subsidy, which the technology receives,
is equal to (1--PRC_MARK)\*(dual variable). This subsidy has to be paid
by the other technologies producing the same commodity. Thus, the costs
of these technologies are increased by the amount PRC_MARK\*(dual
variable). The constraint can therefore be interpreted as a quota system
for the production of a specific technology, e.g. a certificate system
for electricity by a wind technology: each non-wind producer has to buy
certificates according to the quota. The price of the certificates
equals the dual value of the constraint.

###  Equations related to exchanges (EQ_IRE, EQ_IREBND, EQ_XBND)

The three equations in this section concern trade between regions. Since
these equations involve (directly or indirectly) more than one region,
we start their presentation by a complete description of the modeling
approach used, which, as we shall see, involves various schemes for
representing different types of trade. The description already given in
Chapter 4 is also relevant to these equations.

**[Variables]{.underline}**

-   VAR_IRE(r, v, t, p, c, s, ie)

*Description*: The total amount of traded commodity (**c**)
imported/exported (**ie**) to/from region (**r**), through process
(**p**) vintage (**v**) in each time period (**t**)

*Purpose*: The trade variables facilitate trade of commodities between
exporting and importing regions

*Bounds*: The amount of commodity imported to a region from each
exporting region can be directly constrained by the IRE_BND parameter.

*Remarks*:

-   Note that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the VAR_IRE
    variables and the top_ire entries (one variable for the supply
    region/commodity and one variable for the demand region/commodity
    for each instance of top_ire).

-   In market-based trade, the VAR_IRE variables for the market region
    describe the net imports to, and exports from, the market region,
    not the total market volume.

-   There is no variable for the total volume of the commodity market in
    market-based trade. The total volume can only be addressed by means
    of UC_IRE parameters (summing over all imports to or exports from
    the market).

-   In market-based trade, only the amount of commodity imported to a
    region from the market, or exported from the region to the market,
    can be con­strained by the IRE_BND parameter. The imports and exports
    thus cannot be attributed to a specific supply or demand region on
    the other side of the trade.

-   The amount of commodity exported from / imported to a region may
    also be limited by various user constraints. However, unless the
    trade is modeled with bilateral processes, such bounds can only
    apply to the total exports from or imports to a region, and cannot
    apply to e.g. imports from a specific region.

There are only three trade equations, namely a generic trade balance
equation EQ_IRE, and two bounds, EQ(l)\_IREBND and EQ(l)\_XBND. The
generic balance equation, EQ_IRE, can be further divided into two
flavors:

A.  Balance equations for bilateral and other unidirectional trade into
    a single destination region (Cases 1 and 2).

B.  Balance equations for multidirectional trade from single export
    region and multi-lateral market-based trade (Cases 3 and 4).

#### Equation EQ_IRE

**Indices: region (r), year (t), process (p), commodity (c), timeslice
(s)**

**Type: =**

**Related variables: VAR_IRE**

**Related equations: EQ(l)\_IREBND, EQ(l)\_XBND, EQ(l)\_COMBAL,
EQ_ACTFLO**

**Purpose:** This equation defines the balance between the imports of
each traded commodity (**c**) into region (**r**) and the corresponding
exports through each exchange process (**p**) in each time period
(**t**) and timeslice (**s**) of the process.

**Units:** Units of commodity traded. Normally PJ for energy, Mton or
kton for materials or emissions.

**Remarks:**

-   Flows into individual regions may be limited by the IRE_BND and
    IRE_XBND parameters.

-   The equation has two flavors: The first one is for bilateral and
    unidirectional trade with a single destination region, and the
    second is for market-based trade and multidirectional trade from a
    single source region.

##### Case A. Bi-lateral or multilateral unidirectional trade to a single import region

**Equation:**

![](media/image197.wmf)

**Remarks:**

-   The IRE_TSCVT conversion coefficients are in practice provided only
    for some pairs of mapped timeslices between **r2** and **r**.
    Therefore, the timeslice conversion is actually done in two stages:
    First, the timeslices of the VAR_IRE variables are converted to the
    mapped timeslices, and then the mapped timeslices in **r2** to those
    in **r** as follows:

-   The mapping coefficients IRE_TSCVT do not have to be provided by the
    > user if the timeslice definitions in both regions are identical.

-   If the timeslice definitions are different, the user provides the
    > mapping coefficients IRE_TSCVT to convert the timeslice **s2** in
    > region **r2** to the timeslice **s** in region **r**. Since the
    > timeslice level of **s2** may be different from the timeslice
    > level **ts** of the exchange variable in region **r2**, the
    > parameter RTCS_TSFR is used to match **ts** and **s2**.

-   Note that the equation is generated for each period in **rtp** only,
    not for each vintage in **rtp_vintyr** as in the original code. This
    is because **prc_vint** is region-specific. If **prc_vint** is set
    to YES in one region and to NO in another, that would create serious
    sync problems, if the equation were generated for each vintage in
    **rtp_vintyr**. In addition, differences in e.g. NCAP_PASTI,
    NCAP_TLIFE, and NCAP_AF could create sync problems, even if
    **prc_vint** would be set to YES in all regions.

> **\
> **

#####  Case B. Multidirectional and market-based trade between regions.

**Equation:**

![](media/image198.wmf)

**Remarks**:

-   The IRE_TSCVT conversion coefficients are in practice provided only
    for some pairs of mapped timeslices between ***r2*** and ***r***.
    Therefore, the timeslice conversion is actually done in two stages:
    First, the timeslices of the VAR_IRE variables are converted to the
    mapped timeslices, and then the mapped timeslices in ***r2*** to
    those in ***r***.

-   In the case of market-based trading, **prc_aoff** can be used to
    switch off the entire commodity market for periods that fall within
    a range of years. It is also possible to specify multiple entries of
    **prc_aoff**, if, for example trading should be possible only
    between selected years.

-   The **top_ire** entry between the export and import commodity in the
    market region itself is automatically defined by the TIMES model
    generator when necessary, i.e. there is no need to provide it by the
    user.

#### Equation: EQ(*l*)\_IREBND 

**Indices: region (r), year (t), commodity (c), timeslice (s), region2
(all_r), import/export (ie)**

**Type:** Any type, as determined by the bound index **bd** of IRE_BND:

-   l = 'G' for **bd** = 'LO' (lower bound) yields
    ![](media/image118.wmf).

-   l = 'E' for **bd** = 'FX' (fixed bound) yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

-   l = 'L' for **bd** = 'UP' (upper bound) yields
    ![](media/image120.wmf).

**Related variables: VAR_IRE**

**Related equations: EQ_IRE, EQ(l)\_XBND, EQ(l)\_COMBAL**

**Description*:*** Sets a bound for the amount of commodity (c)
imported/exported (ie) to/from region (r), from/to another region
(all_r) in time period (t) and timeslice (s).

**Purpose:** The equation is optional and can be used to set a bound for
a pair-wise inter-regional exchange. The generation of the equation is
triggered by the user-specified parameter IRE_BND.

**Units:** Units of commodity traded. Normally PJ for energy, Mton or
kton for materials or emissions.

**Type:** Set according to the \'l\' index in IRE_BND.

**Remarks:**

-   Total trade flows into/from individual regions may be limited by
    using the IRE_XBND parameter.

**Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: If the primal value equals the bound parameter, the constraint
is binding.

Dual: The dual value describes for a lower/upper bound the cost
increase/decrease in the objective function, if the bound is increased
by one unit. It may also be interpreted as subsidy/tax needed to reach
the given bound value.

**Remarks:**

-   The IRE_TSCVT conversion coefficients are in practice provided only

    Therefore, the timeslice conversion is actually done in two stages:

#### Equation: EQ(*l*)\_XBND 

**Indices: region (r), year (t), commodity (c), timeslice (s), imp/exp
(ie)**

**Type:** Any type, as determined by the bound index **bd** of IRE_XBND:

-   *l* = 'G' for **bd** = 'LO' (lower bound) yields
    ![](media/image118.wmf).

-   *l* = 'E' for **bd** = 'FX' (fixed bound) yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

-   *l* = 'L' for **bd** = 'UP' (upper bound) yields
    ![](media/image120.wmf).

**Related variables: VAR_IRE**

**Related equations: EQ(*l*)\_IRE, EQ(*l*)\_IREBND, EQ(*l*)\_COMBAL**

**Description:** Bound on the total amount of traded commodity (c)
imported/exported (ie) to/from region (all_r) in a period (t) and
timeslice (s).

**Purpose:** This equation bounds inter-regional or exogenous exchanges
in a particular region, across all other regions.

**Units:** Units of commodity traded. Normally PJ for energy, Mton or
kton for materials or emissions.

**Remarks:** Flows into/from individual regions may be limited by the
IRE_BND parameter.

**Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: If the primal value equals the bound parameter, the constraint
is binding.

Dual: The dual value describes for a lower/upper bound the cost
increase/decrease in the objective function, if the bound is increased
by one unit. It may also be interpreted as subsidy/tax needed to reach
the given bound value.

**Equation:**

![](media/image203.wmf)

###  Equations: EQ(*l*)\_INSHR, EQ(*l*)\_OUTSHR

**Indices: region (r), year (t), process (p), commodity (c), commodity
group (cg), time-slice (s)**

**Type:** Any type, as determined by the bound index **bd** of FLO_SHAR:

-   *l* = **\'**G**\'** for **bd** = **\'**LO**\'** (lower bound) yields
    ![](media/image118.wmf).

-   *l* = **\'**E**\'** for **bd** = **\'**FX**\'** (fixed bound) yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

-   *l* = **\'**L**\'** for **bd** = **\'**UP**\'** (upper bound) yields
    ![](media/image120.wmf).

**Related variables:** **VAR_FLO, VAR_ACT**

**Related equations:** **EQ(*l*)\_COMBAL, EQ_PTRANS, EQ_ACTFLO**

**Purpose:** A market/product allocation constraint equation is
generated for each process (**p**) for each time period (**t**) and each
time-slice (**s**) in each region (if desired). It ensures that the
share of an inflow/outflow of a commodity (**c**) is lower/higher/equal
a certain percentage of the total consumption/production of this process
for a specified commodity group (**cg**).

**Quality Control Checks**:

![](media/image204.wmf)

**Remarks**:

-   Exchanging top(r,p,c,'IN')=Input vs. top(r,p,c'OUT') = Output in
    this equation yields EQ(l)\_OUTSHR since **c** is only member of one
    **cg**.

-   The period index of the parameter FLO_SHAR is related to the vintage
    period (**v**) of the process, i.e., if the process is vintaged
    (**prc_vint**), a constraint will be generated for each period
    (**t**) the installation made in the vintage period (**v**) still
    exists (these period pairs are internally provided by the set
    **rtp_vintyr**).

**Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: If the primal value is zero, the constraint is binding. If the
primal value is positive for a lower FLO_SHAR bound or negative for an
upper bound, the constraint is non-binding.

Dual: The dual value describes, for a lower bound, the subsidy needed to
guarantee that the flow is at the given lower bound. The subsidy is
needed, since for an output flow the shadow price of the produced
commodity is too low to cover the production costs of the flow variable
(for an input flow the opposite is true, the commodity is too expensive
to be used in the process). The value of the subsidy that the flow
receives is equal to (1-FLO_SHAR)\*(dual variable). This subsidy has to
be paid by the other flows forming the denominator in FLO_SHAR
constraint, thus, the costs for these flows are increased by the amount
FLO_SHAR\*(dual variable). In a similar way, an upper bound FLO_SHAR can
be interpreted as a tax being added to the costs of a flow.

**Equation:**

![](media/image205.wmf)

###  Equation: EQ_PEAK

**Indices: region (r), period (t), commodity group (cg), time-slice
(s)**

**Type:** ≥

**Related variables: VAR_ACT, VAR_NCAP, VAR_FLO**

**Related equations: EQ(*l*)\_COMBAL, EQ(*l*)\_CAPACT**

**Purpose:** The commodity peaking constraint ensures that the capacity
installed is enough to meet the highest demand in any timeslice, taking
into consideration both adjustments to the average demands tracked by
the model and a reserve margin requiring excess capacity to be
installed.

**Remarks:**

-   In the description below, the production and consumption components
    resemble those of the EQ(l)\_COMBAL commodity balance equation, but
    with a peak contribution/co-incident factor applied to the terms.
    These factors are process dependent and as such are actually applied
    within the referenced expression during the summing operation.

**Sets and parameters involved:**

-   **com_peak(r,cg)** is a flag that a peaking constraint is desired.
    It is optional if **com_pkts(r,cg,s)** is provided

-   **com_pkts(r,cg,s)** are the explicit time slices for which peaking
    constraints are to be constructed. A post-optimization QC check will
    be done to ensure that the timeslice with highest demand is in said
    list. Default is all **com_ts(r,c,s)**.

-   COM_PKRSV(r,t,c) is the peak reserve margin. Default 0.

-   COM_PKFLX(r,t,c,s) is the difference (fluctuation) between the
    average calculated demand and the actual shape of the peak. Default
    0

-   FLO_PKCOI(r,t,p,c,s) is a factor that permits increasing the average
    demand calculated by the model to handle the situation where peak
    usage is typically higher due to coincidental usage at peak moment
    (e.g., air condition). Default 1 for each process consuming **c**.
    User can prevent a process from contributing to the calculation of
    the peak by specifying = 0

-   NCAP_PKCNT(r,t,p,s) is the amount of capacity (activity) to
    contribute to the peak. Default 1 for each process producing
    commodity **c**. User can prevent a process from contributing to the
    peak by specifying = EPS

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **prc_pkaf(r,p)** switch to set NCAP_PKCNT=NCAP_AF/1 as default.
    Default: no

-   **prc_pkno(r,p)** switch to disable process **p** from contributing
    to the peak by its capacity, and to disable also assigning the
    default value of NCAP_PKCNT for the process.

-   **rpc_pkc(r,p,c)** is an internal set defined to contain those
    processes (p) and peaking commodities (c) that will be assumed to
    contribute to the peak by their capacity. Derived by the
    preprocessor from all those process producing commodity **c**, which
    either have **c** as their primary group PG or have **prc_pkaf**
    defined, but are in neither case included in the set **prc_pkno**.

**Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: When the equation is binding, the primal value of the equation
is equal to the RHS constant of the equation, i.e. corresponds to the
maximum output from the existing capacity in the peak timeslice,
adjusted with the peak reserve requirement. When the equation is
non-binding, the primal level also includes the amount of output
capacity exceeding the capacity requirements during the timeslice.

Dual: The dual value of the peaking equation describes the premium
consumers have to pay in addition to the commodity price (dual variable
of EQ(l)\_COMBAL) during the peak timeslice. The premium equals
(1+COM_PKFLX)\*FLO_PKCOI\*RTCS_TSFR\*(dual variable).

###  Equation: EQ_PTRANS

**Indices:** **region (r), year (y), process (p), commodity group1
(cg1), commodity group2 (cg2), time-slice (s)**

**Type**: **=**

**Related variables**: **VAR_FLO, VAR_ACT**

**Related equations**: **EQ(*l*)\_COMBAL, EQ(*l*)\_INSHR,
EQ(*l*)\_OUTSHR, EQ_ACTFLO**

**Purpose**: Allows specifying an equality relationship between certain
inputs and certain outputs of a process e.g. efficiencies at the flow
level, or the modeling of emissions that are tied to the inputs. It is
generated for each process for each time period and each time-slice in
each region.

**Remarks**:

-   Internal set **rps_s1(r,p,s)**: The finer of (set of time slices of
    the most finely divided member of the commodities within the shadow
    primary group (commodities being not part of primary commodity group
    and on the process side opposite to the primary commodity group) and
    the process timeslice level (**prc_tsl**)).

-   The flow variables of the commodities within the primary commodity
    group are modelled on the process level (**prc_tsl**). All other
    flow variables on the timeslice level of **rps_s1**.

-   The internal parameter COEF_PTRAN(r,v,t,p,cg1,c,cg2) is the
    coefficient of the flow variables of commodity **c** belonging to
    the commodity group **cg2**. While FLO_FUNC(r,v,p,cg1,cg2,s)
    establishes a relationship between the two commodity groups **cg1**
    and **cg2**, FLO_SUM(r,v,p,cg1,c,cg2,s) can be in addition specified
    as multiplier for the flow variables of **c** in **cg2**.

> COEF_PTRAN is derived from the user specified FLO_FUNC and FLO_SUM
> parameters based on the following rules:

-   If FLO_FUNC is given between **cg1** and **cg2** but no FLO_SUM for
    the commodities **c** in **cg2**, it is assumed that the FLO_SUMs
    are 1.

-   If FLO_SUM is specified but no FLO_FUNC, the missing FLO_FUNC is set
    to 1.

-   If FLO_SUM(r,v,p,cg1,c,cg2) and FLO_FUNC(r,v,p,cg2,cg1,s) are
    specified, the reciprocal of FLO_FUNC is taken to calculate
    COEF_PTRAN.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   FLO_SUMs can only be specified for the flows within one commodity
    group **cg1** or **cg2** of EQ_PTRANS between these two commodity
    groups, but not for both commodity groups at the same time.

-   By specifying a SHAPE curve through the parameter
    FLO_FUNCX(r,v,p,cg1,cg2) the efficiencies FLO_FUNC and FLO_SUM can
    be described as function of the age of the installation. The
    internal parameter RTP_FFCX contains the average SHAPE multiplier
    for the relevant years in a period (those years in which the
    installed capacity exists).

**Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: The primal value of the transformation is usually zero.

Dual: Due to the flexibility of the transformation equation the
interpretation of its dual value depends on the specific case. For a
simple case, a process with one input flow **c1** and one output flow
**c2** being linked by an efficiency FLO_FUNC(c1,c2), the dual variable,
which is being defined as the cost change when the RHS is increased by
one unit, can be interpreted as cost change when the efficiency of the
process is increased by 1/VAR_FLO(r,v,t,p,c1,s):

###  Equation: EQL_REFIT 

**Indice**s: **region (r), period1 (tt), period2 (t), process (p)**

**Type**: ≤

**Related variables**: **VAR_NCAP, VAR_RCAP, VAR_SCAP**

**Related equations**: **EQ(l)\_CPT**

**Purpose**: This equation bounds the investments into a retrofit (RF)
and lifetime extension (LE) options defined for a host process according
to the available capacity of the host process. The mapping of the RF/LE
options is done be the attribute *PRC_REFIT(reg,prc,p).*

**Remarks:**

-   Defining RF/LE options requires that early retirements are allowed
    in the model.

-   Each host process, for which some RF/LE options are to be included,
    can be modeled to have any number of different RF/LE options;

-   Each of the RF/LE options must be modeled in the same way as any new
    technologies (including the topology, process transformation
    parameters, availabilities, technical lifetime etc.);

-   Whenever the model chooses to invest into a RF/LE option, the same
    amount of capacity of the host process will be simultaneously
    retired;

-   The investment costs for the RF/LE options should include only the
    additional investments for the refurbishment in question, but the
    fixed and variable O&M costs must cover the full costs during the
    RF/LE operation.

**Equation formulation**

When retirements are enabled, the TIMES model generator will generate
the following equations according to the user-defined PRC_REFIT
parameters:

![](media/image216.wmf)

where

-   *RTP_CPTYR~r,v,t,p~* is the TIMES capacity transfer mapping set

-   *COEF_CPT~r,v,t,p~* is the TIMES capacity transfer coefficient
    parameter

-   *DIAG(tt,t)* is the GAMS DIAG function, returning 1 iff *tt*=*t*

-   *SIGN(x)* is the GAMS SIGN function returning ±1 or 0, according to
    the sign of *x*

-   *VAR_NCAP~r,v,p~* is the TIMES new capacity variable

-   *VAR_SCAP~r,v,t,p~* is the TIMES cumulative retirement variable

###  Equations: EQL_SCAP

**Indices: region (r), vintage (v), process (p), indicator (ips)**

**Type**: ≤

**Related variables: VAR_ACT, VAR_NCAP, VAR_SCAP**

**Related equations**: **EQ_CUMRET**

**Purpose**: Establishes an upper bound for the cumulative retirements
and salvaged capacity by process vintage, as well as for the cumulative
process activity. The equation is only generated when early retirements
are allowed for the process, or if the process is vintaged and a maximum
operating life is specified with *NCAP_OLIFE*.

**Notation:**

-   *RVPRL~r,v,p~* is defined as the time (in years) between the vintage
    > year (v) and the last period **t** of availability for that
    > vintage: *RVPRL~r,v,p~* = M(t)--M(v).

### Equations: EQ_SLSIFT

###  {#section-2 .unnumbered}

This block of equations implements the load shifting constraints.
Enabling load-shifting for demand or final energy commodities is
supported by introducing load-shifting processes. Load shifting
processes must be characterized as timeslice storage processes, and must
have *STG_SIFT~r,t,p,D,s~* specified for the load commodity *D*. The
constraints for the load-shifting can be divided into different types,
as described below.

**Indice**s: **region (r), period (t), process (p), time slice (s)**

**Related variables**: **VAR_SIN, VAR_SOUT, VAR_UDP, VAR_UPS**

**Notation:**

-   *P(s)* -- Set of parent timeslice of timeslice
    ![](media/image133.png)![](media/image133.png) in the timeslice tree

-   *C(s)* -- Set of child timeslices of timeslice s in the timeslice
    tree

-   *S~i~* -- Set of timeslices belonging to season *i* (e.g. summer,
    winter)

-   *VAR_DAC~r,t,p,s,bd~* -- activities of bi-directional load storage
    (advance / delay);\
    virtual variables internally implemented with *VAR_UDP*

A.  **Seasonal balances**

**Purpose:** To impose an equality balance for the storage input and
output flows on the seasonal or weekly level (the first level above
DAYNITE in the model). See section 4.3.9 for some more detailed
discussion of load-shifting processes.

**Type**: =

Assume that the output of the load-shifting process is commodity *D*,
and the input is commodity *com*. Usually these would be the same
commodity, i.e. *com*=*D*, but TIMES allows also the load-shifting
process to convert an upstream commodity com into *D*, while shifting
its load. The seasonal balances could then be written as follows:

![](media/image219.wmf)

where the *Si*\'s are the subsets of time-slices in each season
*i* = 1,...,*NS*. For example, *S~1~* could be for winter, *S~2~* for
summer and *S~3~* for intermediate. These constraints ensure that the
entirety of the demand is met and forbid cross-seasonal load shifting.

B.  **Maximum allowed deviations from nominal demand loads**

**Purpose:** To impose a limit for the deviation from the original
demand loads, specified by *STG_SIFT* (in gross terms, i.e. including
any optional efficiency loss that may have been defined by *STG_EFF*).

**Type**: ≤

As the model generator automatically aggregates the demand into
*VAR_COMPRD* variables, on the process timeslices **s** the constraints
for the maximum allowed deviations from the exogenous nominal demand
levels can be formulated as follows:

![](media/image220.wmf)

In addition, the user can also define maximum fractions for the total
load shifting within each season in proportion to the total demand in
that season, by specifying *STG_SIFT(r,y,p,\'ACT\',s)*. In this case,
the constraints for the maximum allowed shifting in proportion to the
seasonal total demand in season *i* can be formulated as follows:

![](media/image221.wmf)

C.  **Balance over user-defined time-window**

**Purpose:** To impose the requirement that withing each N consequtive
hours, the total demand (after load shifting) must be at least equal to
the original (unshifted) demand. This requirement can be specified by
*ACT_TIME(r,y,p,\'N\')*=N.

**Type**: ≥

**Equation:**

![](media/image222.wmf)

D.  **Maximum advance or delay for meeting the shited loads**

**Purpose:** To impose the requirement that the shifted loads have to be
met within at most N hours of advance of delay. This requirement can be
specified by *ACT_TIME(r,y,p,bd)*=N, where bd = FX / UP / LO, such that
LO=advance, UP=delay, and FX means that the limits for advance and delay
are symmetric.

**Type**: = / ≤

**Equations (illustrated here for the symmetric case bd=FX only):**

![](media/image224.wmf)

### Equation: EQ_STGCCL

**Indice**s: **region (r), vintage year (v), period (t), process (p)**

**Type**: ≥

**Related variables**: **VAR_NCAP, VAR_SOUT, VAR_UPS**

**Related equations**: **EQ(l)\_CPT**

**Purpose**: This equation approximates the impact of the storage
degradation on the investment decision, by assuming a targeted maximum
number of cycles per year, *STG_MAXCYC*(r,v,p)/*NCAP_TLIFE*(r,v,p),
where *STG_MAXCYC* is the maximum number of cycles (e.g. 3000 or 4500)
over the lifetime and *NCAP_TLIFE* is the technical lifetime of the
storage process (e.g. 15 years).

**Remarks:**

-   This feature becomes of importance if the investment in a storage
    process is related to the investment of another process, e.g. the
    battery of an electric car. In this example and in the case of
    excessive cycling, the optimiser will opt to pay the replacement
    cost of the battery than re-investing in a car, if the car has not
    reached the end of its lifetime.

-   If the number of cycles in a year exceeds the annual targeted
    cycles, then a replacement of the storage has implicitly happened
    and the replacement capacity that supports this extensive cycling is
    represented with variable *VAR_STGCC*, which is actually a virtual
    cariable (internally implemented with *VAR_UPS~r,v,t,p,s~*). The
    variable is included in the objective function multiplied with the
    annualised investment cost to account for the replacement cost of
    the storage.

### Equations: EQ_STGAUX

**Indices: region (r), vintage (v), period (t), process (p), commodity
(c), timeslice (s)**

**Type**: =

**Related variables: VAR_ACT, VAR_FLO, VAR_SIN, VAR_SOUT**

**Related equations**: **EQ_STGTSS, EQ_STGIPS**

**Purpose**: Establishes the relations between the main storage flows /
activity and auxiliary storage flows.

**Equation:**

![](media/image226.wmf)

###  Equation: EQ_STGTSS/IPS

**Indices**: **region (r), vintage year (v), period (t), process (p),
time-slice (s)**

**Type:** \"=\"

**Related variables: VAR_FLO, VAR_ACT**

**Related equations: EQ(*l*)\_COMBAL, EQ(*l*)\_CAPACT,
EQ(*l*)\_STGIN/OUT**

**Purpose**

-   The model allows two kinds of storage: inter-period storage (IPS),
    and storage across time-slices (or time-slice storage TSS). A
    special type of the TSS storage is a night-storage device, which may
    have an input commodity different from its output commodity. The
    input and output commodity of a night-storage device are given by
    the topology set **top**.

-   Storage processes are special, as they have the same commodity as
    input and output. Also, all other processes transform energy within
    their time-slices and time periods. Since topology (with the
    exception of night-storage devices) does not determine in/out,
    different variables have to be used for this purpose. Similarly,
    since the transformation is special, EQ_PTRANS is replaced by new
    equations for the two types of storage.

**Sets**:

-   **prc_stgips(r,p,c)**: The set of inter-period storage processes.
    They are forced to operate annually.

-   **prc_stgtss(r,p,c)**: The set of time-slice storage processes. A
    storage process can operate only at one particular time slice level.

-   **prc_nstts(r,p,s):** The set contains the allowed charging
    timeslices for a night-storage device.

**Variables:**

-   **VAR_SIN(r,v,t,p,c,s)** -- the average **in** flow to a process
    built in period **v**, during time-slice **s**, during each year of
    period **t**. This variable would appear on the consumption side of
    the balance equation, without any coefficients.

-   **VAR_SOUT(r,v,t,p,c,s)** -- the average **out** flow from a process
    built in period **v**, during time-slice **s**, during each year of
    period **t**. This variable would appear on the supply side of the
    balance equation, multiplied by *STG_EFF* and *COM_IE*.

-   **VAR_ACT(r,v,t,p,s)** -- the energy stored in a storage process at
    the beginning of time-slice **s** (for a timeslice storage) or end
    of period **t** (for an inter-period storage). Note that this is a
    special interpretation of \'activity\', to represent \'storage
    level.\' Therefore, EQ_ACTFLO will not be generated for storage
    processes.

-   In EQ_STGIPS only annual flows are allowed; the timeslice s index is
    set to ANNUAL in this case.

**Equations:**

-   **EQ_STGTSS(r,t,p,s)** -- transforms input to output for the
    timeslice storage processes.

-   **EQ_STGIPS(r,t,p)** -- transforms input to output for the
    interperiod storage processes.

**Parameters:**

-   **STG_LOSS(r,v,p,s)** -- annual energy loss from a storage
    technology, per unit of (average) energy stored.

-   **STG_CHRG(r,t,p,s)** -- exogenous charging of a storage technology.
    For timeslice storage this parameter can be specified for each
    period, while for interperiod storage this parameter can only be
    specified for the first period, to describe the initial content of
    the storage.

###  Equations: EQ(*l*)\_STGIN / EQ(*l*)\_STGOUT

**Indices: region (r), period (t), process (p), commodity (c), timeslice
(s)**

**Type**: Any type, as determined by the bound index **bd** of
STGIN/OUT_BND:

-   *l* = 'G' for **bd** = 'LO' (lower bound) yields
    ![](media/image118.wmf).

-   *l* = 'E' for **bd** = 'FX' (fixed bound) yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

-   *l* = 'L' for **bd** = 'UP' (upper bound) yields
    ![](media/image120.wmf).

**Related variables: VAR_SIN, VAR_SOUT**

**Related equations: EQ_STGTSS, EQ_STGIPS**

**Purpose**: Bound on the input/output flow of a storage process of
commodity (**c**) for a particular process (**p**) in period (**t**) and
timeslice (**s**).

**Remarks:**

-   The constraint bounds the flows in a specific period (**t**)
    irrespectively of the vintage years of the process capacity.

-   The constraint is generated if one of the following conditions is
    true:

    -   Process (**p**) is vintaged, or

    -   the timeslice resolution of the flow variables (VAR_SIN/OUT) are
        below the timeslice (**s**) of the bound parameter.

> In other cases, the bound can be directly applied to the flow variable
> (VAR_SIN/SOUT), so that no extra equation is needed.

-   The timeslice level (**s**) of the bound must be at or higher than
    the timeslice level at which the storage operates.

**Interpretation of the results**:

Primal: If the primal value equals the bound parameter, the constraint
is binding.

Dual: The dual value describes for a lower/upper bound the cost
increase/decrease in the objective function, if the bound is increased
by one unit. It may also be interpreted as subsidy/tax needed to reach
the given bound value.

###  Equations: EQ(*l*)\_UCRTP

**Indices: name (uc_n), region (r), period (t), process (p), type
(uc_grptype), bound (bd)**

**Type**: Any type, as determined by the bound index **bd** of
**uc_dynbnd**:

-   *l* = \'N\' for **bd** = \'LO\' (lower bound) yields
    ![](media/image118.wmf).

-   *l* = \'N\' for **bd** = \'UP\' (upper bound) yields
    ![](media/image120.wmf).

-   *l* = \'E\' for **bd** = \'FX\' (fixed bound) yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

**Related variables: VAR_ACT, VAR_CAP, VAR_NCAP**

**Purpose**: Dynamic bound on the growth/decay in the capacity (CAP),
new capacity (NCAP) or activity level (ACT) of a particular process
(**p**) between period (**t**) and previous period (**t--1**).

**Remarks:**

-   The input set **uc_dynbnd** must be used for flagging the pairs
    (uc_n,bd) to be reserved for dynamic bound constraints.

-   The input parameters UC_CAP, UC_NCAP, and UC_ACT should be used for
    defining the growth/decay coefficients (side=\'LHS\') and RHS
    constants (side=\'RHS\').

-   The growth/decay coefficients (side=\'LHS\') are given as annual
    multipliers (e.g. 1.1 for a 10% annual growth). The RHS constants
    (side=\'RHS\') represent annual absolute values of additional
    growth/decay.

-   The LHS is by default interpolated using option 5. If no LHS is
    specified, the RHS is by default interpolated with the option 10,
    like other bounds. However, if the LHS is also specified, the RHS is
    by default interpolated by the same option as the LHS.

-   Whenever any ***RHS values*** are specified, the constraints will be
    generated for those periods for which the RHS is defined after the
    interpolation/extrapolation. If no RHS is specified, the constraints
    are generated for the periods that have the LHS defined, but
    excluding the first period of technology availability.

-   In the case of dynamic bounds on the activity (ACT), the UC_ACT
    values must be specified at the ANNUAL level, and constraint bounds
    the change in the total activity in a specific period (**t**),
    summing over the process vintages and timeslices.

##  User Constraints

This section on TIMES User Constraints explains the framework that may
be employed by modellers to formulate additional linear constraints,
which are not part of the generic constraint set of TIMES, without
having to bother with any GAMS programming.

### Overview

**Indexes: region (r), time period (t), time slice (s), user constraint
(uc_n)**

**Type:** Any type, as determined by the bound index **bd** of
*UC_RHS*(*R*)(*T*)(*S*)~(*r*)*,uc_n,*(*t*)*,*(*s*)*,bd*~ :

-   *l* = \'G\' for **bd** = \'LO\' (lower bound) yields
    ![](media/image118.wmf).

-   *l* = \'E\' for **bd** = \'FX\' (fixed bound) yields
    ![](media/image119.wmf).

-   *l* = \'L\' for **bd** = \'UP\' (upper bound) yields
    ![](media/image120.wmf).

**Related variables:** VAR_ACT, VAR_CAP, VAR_FLO, VAR_IRE, VAR_NCAP,
VAR_COMPRD, VAR_COMNET, VAR_CUMCOM, VAR_CUMFLO, VAR_UPS

**Related equations:** EQ(l)\_COMBAL, EQ(l)\_CPT

**Purpose:** The user constraints in TIMES provide a modeler with a
flexible framework to add case-study specific constraints to the
standard equation set embedded in TIMES. With the help of the user
constraints virtually any possible linear relationship between variables
in TIMES can be formulated. Examples of user constraints are quotas for
renewables in electricity generation or primary energy consumption, GHG
reduction targets, absolute bounds on the minimum amount of electricity
generated by various biomass technologies, etc.

Four types of user constraints can be distinguished in TIMES:

-   Pure LHS (left hand side) user constraints,

-   Timeslice-dynamic user constraints,

-   Dynamic user constraints of type (t, t+1), and

-   Dynamic user constraints of type (t--1, t).

In addition, the dynamic bound constraints (see EQ_UCRTP) also employ
user constraint names and UC\_\* attributes, but these constraints are
based on prescribed expressions and are thus not considered genuine user
constraints.

In the following four subsections, the different types of user
constraints are briefly presented. Their mathematical formulations are
then presented in a new section.

*[LHS user constraints]{.underline}*

The so-called LHS user constraints have the following main structure:

![](media/image237.wmf)

To identify the user constraint, the modeller has to give it a unique
name **uc_n**. The LHS expression *LHS~r,t,s~* consists of the sum of
various TIMES variables (VAR_ACT, VAR_FLO, VAR_COMPRD, VAR_COMNET,
VAR_NCAP, VAR_CAP), multiplied by corresponding coefficients (UC_ACT,
UC_FLO, UC_COMPRD, UC_COMCON, UC_NCAP, UC_CAP). The coefficients are
input data given by the modeller and serve thus also as an indicator of
which variables are being components of the user constraint.

With respect to region **r**, time period **t** and timeslice **s**, the
user constraint is either specified for specific regions, periods or
timeslices or the expression within the user constraint is summed over
subsets of regions, periods and timeslices. In the first case, the
regions, periods or timeslices for which the user constraint should be
generated are given by the sets **uc_r_each**, **uc_t_each** or
**uc_ts_each**, while in the latter case, summation sets are specified
by the sets **uc_r_sum**, **uc_t_sum** and **uc_ts_sum**. The
corresponding sets **uc_x_each/sum** are exclusive, so that for example,
if **uc_t_each** has been specified, the set **uc_t_sum** cannot be
specified and vice versa. By choosing **uc_x_each/sum** also the name
and the index domain of the user constraint are specified, e.g. if
**uc_r_each**, **uc_t_each** and **uc_ts_sum** are given, the user
constraint has the name and index domain *EQ(l)\_UCRT~r,uc_n,t~*. It is
generated for each region and period specified by **uc_r_each** and
**uc_t_each**, respectively, and is summing within the user constraint
over the timeslices given in **uc_ts_each**. The name of the RHS
constraint depends in the same way on the choice of **uc_x_each/sum**.
In the previous example, the RHS constant has the name and index domain
*UC_RHSRT~r,uc_n,t,bd~*. The knowledge of these naming rules is
**important**, since the modeller has to give the correct RHS parameter
names depending on the choice of **uc_x_each/sum** when defining a user
constraint.

Since for each of the three dimensions (region, period, timeslice), two
options (EACH or SUM) exist, this would result in 8 possible
combinations of user constraint equations (Figure 5.6). However, the
combinations EQ(l)\_UCS and EQ(l)\_UCRS, which would lead to a
constraint being generated for specific timeslices while summing over
time periods at the same time, have been considered unrealistic, so that
6 variants remain. It should be noted that the sets **uc_r_each/sum**,
**uc_t_each/sum** and **uc_ts_each/sum** can contain an arbitrary
combination of elements, e.g. the periods specified in **uc_t_each/sum**
do not have to be consecutive.

![](media/image238.wmf)

Figure 14: The allowed combinations of region, period and timeslice for
user constraints.

The RHS (right hand side) of this category of user constraint consists
of a constant ![](media/image239.wmf) which is provided by the modeller.
The RHS constant also defines the equation type of the user constraint.
If the RHS constant has the index FX, the user constraint is generated
as strict equality (=). If the RHS index is LO (respectively UP), the
constraint has ![](media/image240.wmf) (respectively
![](media/image241.wmf)) inequality sign. It should be noted that a RHS
user constraint is only generated when a RHS constant is specified (this
feature may be used to easily turn-on/off user constraints between
different scenarios).

In addition to the coefficients UC_ACT, UC_FLO, etc. also some model
input attributes may be used as coefficient for the variables in a user
constraint. The model attribute being used as coefficient in a user
constraint is specified by the set *UC_ATTR~r,uc_n,\'LHS\',VAR,ATTR~*
with the indicator VAR for the variable (ACT, FLO, IRE, NCAP, CAP,
COMNET, COMPRD) and the index ATTR representing the attribute being used
(COST, SUB, TAX, DELIV, INVCOST, INVSUB, INVTAX, CAPACT, CAPFLO, NEWFLO,
ONLINE, EFF, NET, CUMSUM, PERIOD, GROWTH, see Section for more
information).

Instead of defining different equality types of user constraints
depending on the bound type of ![](media/image242.wmf) an alternative
formulation can be used in TIMES. In this formulation a variable
![](media/image243.wmf) is created that is set equal to the LHS
expression. The RHS bounds are then applied to these variables.

![](media/image244.wmf)

The alternative formulation is created when the dollar control parameter
VAR_UC (see Part III for the use of dollar control parameters) is set to
YES by the modeller, while in the default case the first formulation is
used.

*[Timeslice-dynamic user constraints]{.underline}*

Timeslice-dynamic user constraints establish a relationship between two
successive timeslices within a timeslice cycle. The LHS expression
*LHS~r,t,s~* is generated for timeslice **s**, whereas the RHS
expression *RHS~r,t,s--1~* is generated for the preceding timeslice
**s--**RS_STG(r,s) under the same parent timeslice. Timeslice-dynamic
user constraints of type can thus be written as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image245.wmf)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table C-3*.* ETL-specific model variables

Timeslice-dynamic user constraints are always specific to a single
region and period. To build a timeslice-dynamic user constraint, the
modeller must identify the desired timeslice level of the constraint, by
using the set **uc_tsl***~r,uc_n,side,tsl~*, and the RHS constants must
be defined by using the UC_RHSRTS parameter. As an alternative to using
**uc_tsl**, **uc_attr***~r,uc_n,side,uc_grptype,tslvl~* can also be
used, with any **uc_grptype** (**ucn** recommended). The constraint will
be genuinely dynamic only if **uc_tsl** is specified on the RHS. This is
the only type of user constraint for which the RHS constant parameter is
levelized, according the timeslice level identified by **uc_tsl**. That
can make the RHS specification much easier.

*[Dynamic user constraints]{.underline}*

Dynamic user constraints establish a relationship between two
*consecutive* periods. The LHS expression *LHS~r,t,s~* is generated for
period **t**, whereas the for the RHS expression either the term
*RHS~r,t+1,s~* corresponding to the period **t+1**, or the term
*RHS~r,t--1,s~* corresponding to the period **t--1** is generated,
according to the dynamic type.

Dynamic user constraints of type (**t,t+1**) can thus be written as
follows:

![](media/image246.wmf)

Similarly, dynamic user constraints of type (**t--1,t**) can be written
as follows:

![](media/image247.wmf)

To build a dynamic user constraint of type (**t,t+1**), between the
periods **t** and **t+1**, the modeller identifies the desired set of
time periods that will be used as first periods in the pairs (**t**,
**t+1**). This set is named **uc_t_succ** (note that the sets
**uc_t_sum** and **uc_t_each** are not used in the context of dynamic
user constraints, and are reserved for the pure LHS user constraints
described in the previous section). In addition, the RHS constant
parameter must be defined for all of these time periods.

To build a dynamic user constraint of type (**t--1,t**), between the
periods **t--1** and **t**, the modeller should indicate the desired
type by defining for the constraint any UC_ATTR attribute using the
\'RHS\' side. In addition, the desired set of time periods that will be
used as the second period in the pairs(**t--1,t**) should be identified
by defining the RHS constant parameter for those periods **t**.

The choice between the dynamic types (**t,t+1**) or (**t--1,t**) is
usually only a matter of convenience. However, while using the
(**t,t+1**) type requires explicit specification of **uc_t_succ**, for
using the (**t--1,t**) type, any UC_ATTR on the RHS is sufficient to
trigger that dynamic type and will cause auto-generation of
**uc_t_succ** for all milestone years.

For both types of dynamic constraints, only four combinations with
respect to the region and timeslice domain are possible:

-   EQ(l)\_UCSU: dynamic user constraint summing **r** over **uc_r_sum**
    > and **s** over **uc_ts_sum**,

-   EQ(l)\_UCRSU: dynamic user constraint being generated for each
    > region **uc_r_each** and summing **s** over **uc_ts_sum**,

-   EQ(l)\_UCRSUS: dynamic user constraint being generated for each
    > region **uc_r_each** and timeslice **uc_ts_each** and

-   EQ(l)\_UCSUS: dynamic user constraint summing **r** over
    > **uc_r_sum** and being generated for each timeslice **s** in set
    > **uc_ts_each**.

The input parameters for defining the coefficients, UC_ACT, UC_FLO,
UC_IRE, UC_COMCON, UC_COMNET, UC_COMPRD, UC_NCAP and UC_CAP all have an
index **side**, which can be either LHS or RHS, to identify on which
side of the user constraint the corresponding variables should appear.
The LHS index corresponds always to the period **t**, while the RHS
index is related either to the **t+1** or the **t--1** term.

As for LHS user constraints, setting the dollar control parameter VAR_UC
to YES yields a strict equality type of dynamic user constraint
(EQE_UCSU, EQE_UCRSU, EQE_UCRSUS, EQE_UCSUS) with the RHS constant
replaced by a user constraint variable (VAR_UCT, VAR_UCRT, VAR_UCRTS,
VAR_UCTS). The bound given by the RHS constant is then applied to the
user constraint variable.

*[Growth constraints]{.underline}*

Growth (or decay) constraints are a special type of dynamic constraints.
A growth constraint may for example express that the capacity increase
between two periods is limited by an annual growth rate. So, growth
constraints relate variables in one period to the ones in the previous
or following period as in dynamic constraints described in the previous
section. In growth constraints, however, in addition some of the
variable coefficients UC_ACT, UC_FLO, UC_IRE, UC_COMNET, UC_COMPRD,
UC_NCAP, UC_CAP can represent annual growth (or decay) rates[^45] by
specifying the set *UC_ATTR~r,uc_n,\'LHS\',VAR,ATTR~* with the index
ATTR being set to GROWTH. This will cause the coefficient of the
corresponding variable being interpreted as an annual growth rate. If
for example the input information
*UC_ATTR~\'REG1\',\'G_1\',\'LHS\',\'CAP\',\'GROWTH\'~* is given for the
user constraint G_1, the coefficient
*UC_CAP~\'G_1\',\'LHS\',\ \'REG1\',t,p~* of the capacity variable of
technology **p** will be interpreted as annual growth rate and the final
coefficient of the variable VAR_CAP in the user constraint will be
calculated in the following way:

![](media/image248.wmf).

With the help of the input set UC_ATTR, growth coefficients can be
defined for the variables in LHS expression (as in the example) or for
the variables in RHS expression. If a growth rate is defined for
variables on the LHS, the exponent is M(t+1)--M(t), whereas for RHS
variables the exponent is equal to M(t)--M(t+1).

If at least one growth coefficient is defined for a LHS variable, the
dynamic constraint will be assumed to be of type (**t**,**t+1**)
described above. In this case, the growth constraints are generated for
the period pairs **t** and **t+1** for all periods **t** of the model
horizon with the exception of the last period.

If, however, all growth coefficients are specified for the RHS
variables, the dynamic constraint will be assumed to be of type
(**t--1,t**), and the growth constraints are now generated for the
period pairs **t**--1 and **t** for all periods of the model horizon. In
this alternative RHS formulation, it is possible to introduce boundary
conditions that are usually needed for the first period.

[Example of defining a simple growth constraint:]{.underline}

The annual capacity increase of technology E01 between two periods
should not exceed 2% for model covering the three ten-year periods 1990,
2000 and 2010. So one wants to create user constraints expressing:

![](media/image249.wmf)

The summand 1 on the LHS expresses an initial capacity value, so that
capacity growth can start from this starting point, e.g. if
*VAR_CAP~\'REG1\',\'1990\',\'E01\'~* is zero, the model can invest at
most 1 capacity unit in the year 2000:
1 ≥ *VAR_CAP~\'REG1\',\'2000\',\'E01\'~*.

Since growth constraints should be generated for the first two periods,
but not the last one, the growth constraint should be of type
(**t**,**t**+1). The specification of the growth constraint called 'G_1'
in GAMS looks like:

SET UC_N /

G_1

/

\* Specify growth of capacity on the LHS

SET UC_ATTR /

REG1.G_1.LHS.CAP.GROWTH

/

\* Specify growth coefficient for E01 on LHS (period 1) and coefficient

\* for capacity on RHS (period t+1)

PARAMETER UC_CAP /

\* on the LHS

G1.LHS.REG1.2000.E01 1.02

\* on the RHS

G1.RHS.REG1.2000.E01 1

/

\* Specify RHS constant for the years t to have the constraint

PARAMETER UC_RHSRTS /

REG1.G_1.1990.ANNUAL.LO -1

REG1.G_1.2000.ANNUAL.LO -1

/;

One should note that the period index used for the UC_CAP on the LHS is
related to the period **t**, while the period index on the RHS is
related to the period **t**+1. The RHS UC_RHSRTS constant is provided
for the time period **t** of the LHS.

Since a growth coefficient is specified for the LHS, the user constraint
is automatically identified as a dynamic growth constraint, so that the
set **uc_t_succ** does not need to be provided by the user. The
constraint will be generated for all periods for which the RHS parameter
UC_RHSRTS is given.

In the following section, we give the full descriptions of the available
user constraints in each category, along with a reminder of the
corresponding variables.

**Mathematical descriptions of user constraints**

[List of user constraints and variables]{.underline}

We first show the complete list of user constraints in the three
categories.

The following types of LHS user constraints exist:

-   *EQ(l)\_UC~uc_n~* : user constraint summing over regions
    **uc_r_sum**, periods **uc_t_sum** and timeslices **uc_ts_sum**,

-   *EQ(l)\_UCR~r,uc_n~* : user constraint generated for regions
    **uc_r_each** and summing over periods **uc_t_sum** and timeslices
    **uc_ts_sum**,

-   *EQ(l)\_UCT~uc_n,t~* : user constraint generated for periods
    **uc_t_each** and summing over regions **uc_r_sum** and timeslices
    **uc_ts_sum**,

-   *EQ(l)\_UCRT~r,uc_n,t~* : user constraint generated for regions
    **uc_r_each** and periods **uc_t_each** and summing over timeslices
    **uc_ts_sum**,

-   *EQ(l)\_UCTS~uc_n,t,s~* : user constraint generated for periods
    **uc_t_each**, timeslices **uc_ts_each** and summing over regions
    **uc_r_sum**,

-   *EQ(l)\_UCRTS~r,uc_n,t,s~* : user constraint generated for regions
    **uc_r_each**, periods **uc_t_each** and timeslices **uc_ts_each**.

The placeholder **l** reflects the equation type of the user constraint
(**l**=E, G or L) corresponding to the bound type of the RHS constant.
In case the dollar control parameter VAR_UC is set to YES, the user
constraints are always strict equalities (**l**=E) with the RHS
constants replaced by the following user constraint variables:

-   *VAR_UC~uc_n\ ~*: user constraint variable for EQE_UC,

-   *VAR_UCR~r,uc_n\ ~*: user constraint variable for EQE_UCR,

-   *VAR_UCT~uc_n,t\ ~*: user constraint variable for EQE_UCT,

-   *VAR_UCRT~r,uc_n,t\ ~*: user constraint variable for EQE_UCRT,

-   *VAR_UCTS~uc_n,t,s\ ~*: user constraint variable for EQE_UCTS,

-   *VAR_UCRTS~uc_n,r,t,s\ ~*: user constraint variable for EQE_UCRTS.

The following types of dynamic user constraints and growth constraints
exist:

-   *EQ(l)\_UCSU~uc_n,t~* : user constraint generated for periods
    **uc_t_succ**, summing over regions **uc_r_sum** and timeslices
    **uc_ts_sum**,

-   *EQ(l)\_UCRSU~r,uc_n,t~* : user constraint generated for regions
    **uc_r_each** and periods **uc_t_succ** and summing over timeslices
    **uc_ts_sum**,

-   *EQ(l)\_UCSUS~uc_n,t,s~* : user constraint generated for periods
    **uc_t_succ**, timeslices **uc_ts_each** and summing over regions
    **uc_r_sum**,

-   *EQ(l)\_UCRSUS~r,uc_n,t,s~* : user constraint generated for regions
    **uc_r_each**, periods **uc_t_succ** and timeslices **uc_ts_each**.

The placeholder ***l*** reflects the equation type of the user
constraint (***l***=E, G or L) corresponding to the bound type of the
RHS constant. In case the dollar control parameter VAR_UC is set to YES,
the user constraints are always strict equalities (***l***=E) with the
RHS constants replaced by the following user constraint variables:

-   *VAR_UCT~uc_n,t\ ~*: user constraint variable for EQE_UCSU,

-   *VAR_UCRT~r,uc_n,t\ ~*: user constraint variable for EQE_UCRSU,

-   *VAR_UCTS~uc_n,t,s\ ~*: user constraint variable for EQE_UCSUS,

-   *VAR_UCRTS~uc_n,r,t,s\ ~*: user constraint variable for EQE_UCRSUS.

[Sets and parameters related to user constraints]{.underline}

The following sets and parameters are related to the user constraint
framework in TIMES.

**Sets**

[Predefined internal sets:]{.underline}

-   ![](media/image250.wmf): set having the two elements *LHS* and *RHS*
    > (elements are fixed and not under user control),

-   ![](media/image251.wmf): set having the elements *ACT*, *FLO*,
    > *IRE*, *COMCON*, *COMNET*, *COMPRD*, *NCAP*, *CAP, UCN*, and used
    > in the multi-dimensional set *UC_ATTR* (elements are fixed and not
    > under user control),

-   ![](media/image252.wmf): set having the following attribute names as
    > elements: *COST, SUB, TAX, DELIV, INVCOST, INVSUB, INVTAX,
    > BUILDUP, CAPACT, CAPFLO, NEWFLO, ONLINE, EFF, NET, CUMSUM,
    > PERDISC, PERIOD, GROWTH* and *SYNC*, used in the multi-dimensional
    > set *UC_ATTR* (elements are fixed and not under user control).

[User-specified sets:]{.underline}

-   **uc_n**: unique name of the user constraint,

-   **uc_r_each~r,uc_n~** : regions **r** for which the user constraint
    **uc_n** is generated,

-   **uc_r_sum~r,uc_n~**: regions **r** being summed over in the user
    constraint **uc_n**,

-   **uc_t_each~r,uc_n,t~** : periods **t** for which the user
    constraint **uc_n** is generated,

-   **uc_t_sum~r,uc_n,t~** : periods **t** being summed over in the user
    constraint **uc_n**,

-   **uc_ts_each~r,uc_n,ts~** : timeslices **ts** for which the user
    constraint **uc_n** is generated,

-   **uc_ts_sum~r,uc_n,ts~** : timeslices **ts** being summed over in
    the user constraint **uc_n**,

-   **uc_tsl ~r,uc_n,side,tslvl~** : timeslice level **tslvl** of user
    constraint **uc_n**,

-   **uc_attr~r,uc_n,side,uc_grptype,uc_name\ ~**: indicator that the
    attribute **uc_name** on the RHS or LHS **side** of the user
    constraint **uc_n** as coefficient of the variable given by
    **uc_grptype**.

If neither **uc_r_each** nor **uc_r_sum** are given, the default is set
to all **uc_r_each** containing all internal regions. In a similar
fashion **uc_t_each** being set to all milestoneyears is the default, if
neither **uc_t_each** or **uc_t_sum** are specified. The default for the
timeslice dimension is **uc_ts_each** being set to all timeslices for
which the RHS constants UC_RHSRS or UC_RHSRTS are being specified.

    successive periods in the constraint (for dynamic user constraints).

###  LHS user constraints

**Mathematical formulation of LHS user constraints**

In the mathematical description of the different variants of LHS user
constraints the following placeholders are used for clarity reasons:
*ACT~r,t,p,s,\'LHS\'~*, *FLO~r,t,p,s,\'LHS\'~*, *IRE~r,t,p,s,\'LHS\'~*,
*COMPRD~r,t,s,\'LHS\'~*, *COMNET~r,t,s,\'LHS\'~*,
*NCAP~r,t,p,s,\'LHS\'~*, *CAP~r,t,p,s,\'LHS\'~*, *CUMCOM~r~* and

the part of the user constraint related to the activity variable.

### Timeslice-dynamic user constraints

**Mathematical formulation of timeslice-dynamic user constraints**

In the mathematical description of the different variants of
timeslice-dynamic user constraints, on the LHS the same placeholders can
be used as for pure LHS user constraints: *ACT~r,t,p,s,\'LHS\'~*,
*FLO~r,t,p,s,\'LHS\'~*, *IRE~r,t,p,s,\'LHS\'~*, *COMPRD~r,t,s,\'LHS\'~*,
*COMNET~r,t,s,\'LHS\'~*, *NCAP~r,t,p,s,\'LHS\'~*,
*CAP~r,t,p,s,\'LHS\'~*. The LHS placeholder expressions are identical to
those of LHS user constraints.

On the RHS (preceding timeslice ***ds*** = ***s***--RS_STG(r,s)), the
following placeholders can be used: *ACT~r,t,p,ds,\'RHS\'~*,
*FLO~r,t,p,ds,\'RHS\'~*, *IRE~r,t,p,ds,\'RHS\'~*,
*COMPRD~r,t,ds,\'RHS\'~*, *COMNET~r,t,ds,\'RHS\'~*,
*NCAP~r,t,p,ds,\'RHS\'~*, *CAP~r,t,p,ds,\'RHS\'~*. The RHS placeholder
expressions can be written by replacing in them the timeslice index
**s** by **d(s)**.

Note that the timeslice-specific terms in the equation are all divided
by G_YRFR~r,s~ in order to make it easy to combine flow and capacity
terms in the constraint.

### User constraint modifiers

#### Overview

The user constraint facility in TIMES provides a very powerful tool for
specifying a large variety of custom user constraints in a TIMES model.
Such constraints can refer to practically any combination of individual
variables. Moreover, the constraint definitions can be optionally
refined by specifying additional modifier attributes that are applied to
specific components (variable terms) of the constraints. The modifier
attributes available in the current version are listed in Table 25. The
note \"DYN only\" in the table means that the attribute is valid for
dynamic constraints only (the constraint is in those cases automatically
defined as dynamic if the attribute is used).

As indicated in Table 25, one can easily specify, for example, that the
FLO coefficients of the user constraint should apply to the sum of all
annual flows in each period, by using the PERIOD attribute. In addition,
as cumulative user constraints (summed over periods) are typically
almost always meant to be applied also to the sum of the annual
flows/activities in each period, the PERIOD modifier is now by default
applied to the FLO, ACT, IRE, COMPRD and COMCON components of all
cumulative constraints (this can be overridden by the explicit use of
the input set **uc_ts_sum** for the constraint). The specification of
various kinds of cumulative constraints is thus possible quite easily.

#### Cost modifiers (COST, TAX, SUB, DELIV)

The cost modifiers are applied to the variable terms by multiplying them
with the corresponding cost attribute, or with the sum of multiple cost
attributes, if several cost modifiers are specified. The expressions for
the *FLO~r,t,p,s,\'LHS\'~* term above in section 6.4.2 give a detailed
example of how the cost attributes are applied. The cost attributes
applied are the following (where the SUB terms are taken as negative
values):

-   COST: ACT_COST for ACT, FLO_COST for FLO/IRE, NCAP_COST for NCAP,
    > COM_CSTNET for COMNET, and COM_CSTPRD for COMPRD

-   TAX: FLO_TAX for FLO/IRE, NCAP_ITAX for NCAP, COM_TAXNET for COMNET,
    > and COM_TAXPRD for COMPRD

-   SUB: FLO_SUB for FLO/IRE, NCAP_ISUB for NCAP, COM_SUBNET for COMNET,
    > and COM_SUBPRD for COMPRD

-   DELIV: FLO_DELIV for FLO/IRE

#### Annuity modifiers (INVCOST, INVTAX, INVSUB)

The annuity modifiers are applied to the variable terms by summing the
VAR_NACP variables over all vintage periods tt ≤ t that have an annual
investment payment in period t, and multiplying these with the annual
cost coefficient. The INVCOST modifier applies the investment cost
payments, the INVTAX modifier the tax payments, and the INVSUB modifier
the subsidy payments (taken as negative values). By combining several of
these modifiers, the payments are summed together.

  : Table C-4. ETL-specific model constraints

#### BUILDUP modifier

The BUILDUP modifier can only be applied only to the NCAP terms of user
constraints, when such exist. The NCAP term for each process is divided
by the lead time (LEAD(T)) of the milestone year T of the NCAP variable,
when the modifier is used, to get the annual build-up of the new
capacity.

#### CAPACT modifier

The CAPACT modifier is applied only to the CAP terms of user
constraints, if such exist. The CAP term for each process is multiplied
by the PRC_CAPACT parameter of that process when the modifier is used.

#### CAPFLO modifier

The CAPFLO modifier is applied only to the FLO terms of user
constraints, if such exist. When the modifier is used, the FLO term for
each process/commodity, which normally includes only the VAR_FLO
variables, is augmented by the capacity-related flows of the same
commodity, if such exists.

#### CUMSUM modifier

The CUMSUM attribute means that the corresponding variable term for any
milestone year **t** consists of the cumulative sum of the variables in
all previous periods up to (and including) the year **t**. For example,
when combined with the INVCOST attribute, the resulting NCAP variable
term represents the cumulative sum of capital cost annuities related to
all new capacities installed up to the year **t**, which are paid in
year **t**.

#### EFF modifier

The EFF modifier can currently only be applied to COMPRD/COMCON/COMNET,
and it causes the variable terms to be either multiplied or divided by
the commodity efficiency COM_IE. For COMPRD, the variable terms will
refer to the net production after taking into account the commodity
efficiency COM_IE. For COMCON, it will refer to the gross consumption
before applying the commodity efficiency COM_IE, and with COMNET it will
refer to the gross NET production (gross production minus gross
consumption).

#### GROWTH modifier

The GROWTH modifier used for a variable term causes the user constraint
coefficients specified for that term to be interpreted as annual
growth/decay coefficients. For example, a coefficient of 1.1 will be
interpreted as a growth coefficient corresponding to a 10% annual
growth. The final effective coefficient applied to the variable term
will be the growth/decay coefficient raised to the power (M(t)--M(t--1))
or (M(t+1)--M(t)), depending on the dynamic type.

#### NET modifier

The NET modifier can only be applied to COMPRD/COMCON. For COMPRD, it
causes the variable terms to represent the net amount of production
after consumption is subtracted (i.e. gross production in excess of
gross consumption). For COMCON, it represents the net consumption in
excess of net production (after applying COM_IE), which is normally a
non-positive value. Using COMPRD with the NET modifier will thus result
in the same variable term as when using COMNET with the EFF modifier.

#### NEWFLO modifier

The NEWFLO modifier can only be applied to the ACT, FLO and IRE variable
terms. The modifier causes the variable terms to be restricted to the
flows or activities of newly installed capacity vintages in the
commissioning period only, whenever the process is vintaged. For
non-vintaged processes, the modifier has no effect. Therefore, for
making consistent use of the modifier, usually all processes referred to
in the variable terms should be vintaged when this modifier is used.

#### ONLINE modifier

The ONLINE modifier can only be used with the CAP variable term. It
causes the capacity term to be referring to the on-line capacity instead
of the full installed capacity. However, in TIMES, the on-line capacity
of a process may differ from the full capacity only when start-ups and
shut-downs have been modelled, by defining a minimum stable operating
level with the parameter ACT_MINLD.

#### PERDISC modifier

The PERDISC modifier can be used for adding the period-wise discounting
multiplier for components related to activities and flows. As a result,
the component term will represent the discounted amount for each period,
and so if a cost multiplier is also applied, the constraint component
will represent the discounted costs related to activities or flows.

#### PERIOD modifier

The PERIOD modifier can be used for all other components (variable
terms) except for the CAP term. For the ACT, FLO, IRE, COMPRD, COMCON,
and COMNET terms, the modifier adds the multiplier D(t), i.e. they are
multiplied by the period length. For the NCAP term, the modifier
multiplies the new capacity variable for each period by the number of
repeated investments in that period.

#### SYNC modifier

The SYNC modifier can be used on the RHS for any component of a user
component to signify that the RHS term should refer to the same period
as the LHS term. It will also automatically declare the constraint to be
dynamic of type (**t--1,t**), unless **uc_t_succ** is defined or the
GROWTH modifier is used on the LHS side, which both force it to be of
type (**t,t+1**).

#### \<TSLVL\> modifier

Timeslice levels can also be used as a modifier for any component, when
the constraint is meant to be timeslice-dynamic. It is an alternative
way to set the UC_TSL(r,uc_n,side,tslvl) attribute. Note that even
though the modifier can be used with any component, it is important that
only a single tslvl level is specified on a single side for the
constraint where this modifier is used, otherwise the resulting
constraint may be generated in unexpected ways not designed to be
supported.

#### YES modifier

The only function of the YES modifier is to declare the user constraint
to be dynamic. The constraint will be of type (**t--1,t**), unless
**uc_t_succ** is defined or the GROWTH modifier is used on the LHS side,
which forces it to be of type (**t,t+1**). Using this modifier can thus
be useful, if there are no other relevant modifiers to be used on the
RHS of the constraint, which would automatically declare the constraint
dynamic.

### Non-binding user constraints

Non-binding user constraints of any type (intoduced for reporting
purposes) can be defined in the same way as binding constraints, but
using the \'N\' lim type when specifying the UC_RHSxxx constant, with
any value defined for it (--1 is recommended). Non-binding user
constraints can only be defined when user constraint variables are
enabled (i.e. when using the option \$SET VAR_UC YES). The levels of the
non-ninding constraints (i.e. the levels of the slack variables) are
reported in the PAR_UCSL reporting attribute (see Section 3.3).

######  The TIMES Climate Module 

####### Introduction

This Appendix contains the updated (November 2010) documentation on the
Climate Module option for the TIMES model. It provides is a streamlined
version of the older version, and contains 5 sections: section 2
contains a detailed description of the theoretical approach taken,
section 3 describes the parameters of the climate module, section 4 the
variables and section 5 the equations. This version of the documentation
does not include the complete formulations for all of the Climate
equations (in GAMS form), and neither does it include the full GAMS
specifications. However, it should be sufficient to gain a complete
understanding of the equations in mathematical form, and should enable
the user to define the parameters of the climate module.

####### Mathematical formulation

The Climate Module starts from the global emissions of CO~2~, CH~4~, and
N~2~O, as generated by the TIMES global model, and proceeds to compute
successively:

-   the changes in CO~2~, CH~4~, and N~2~O concentrations via three
    > separate sets of equations,

-   the total change (over pre-industrial times) in atmospheric
    > radiative forcing resulting from the three gases plus an
    > exogenously specified additional forcing resulting from other
    > causes (other anthropogenic and/or natural causes, as defined by
    > the user), and

-   the temperature changes (over pre-industrial times) in two
    > reservoirs (surface and deep ocean).

The Climate Equations used to perform these calculations were initially
adapted from Nordhaus and Boyer (1999), who proposed linear recursive
equations for calculating concentrations and temperature changes based
on the CO~2~ life cycle. These linear equations give results that are
good approximations of those obtained from more complex climate models
(Drouet *et al.*, 2004; Nordhaus and Boyer, 1999). The non-linear
radiative forcing equation used by these authors and in TIMES is the
same as the one used in most models. The choice of the Nordhaus and
Boyer's climate equations is motivated by the simplicity of their
approach and by the fact that their climate module is well-documented
and acceptably accurate. In our implementation, the forcing equation has
been replaced by a linear approximation whose values closely approach
the exact ones as long as the useful range is carefully selected. This
was done in order to keep the entire model linear, and therefore to
allow the user to set constraints on forcing and on temperature as well
as on concentrations and on emissions.

Rigorously, the concentration and forcing equations used in the climate
module are applicable only to CO2 emissions, since the concentration
equations simulate the carbon cycle. In order to model other GHGs, one
way is to use these same equations, while replacing CO2 emissions by
CO2-equivalent emissions of any number of gases endogenous to the model.
However, a more detailed and generally preferable approach is to model
separately the life cycle of each endogenous emission separately, and
this is the approach used in TIMES. The additional forcing due to the
remaining (non endogenous) emissions, is accounted for via an exogenous
forcing quantity directly defined by the user.

We now describe the mathematical equations used at each of the three
steps of the climate module.

######## Concentrations (accumulation of CO2, CH4, N2O)

a\) CO2 accumulation is represented as the linear three-reservoir model
below[^46]: the atmosphere, the quickly mixing upper ocean + biosphere,
and the deep ocean. CO2 flows in both directions between adjacent
reservoirs. The 3-reservoir model is represented by the following 3
equations when the step of the recursion is equal to one year:

*M~atm~ (y) = E(y) + (1 -- φ~atm-up~) M~atm~ (y--1) +φ~up-atm~ M~up~
(y--1) (1)*

*M~up~ (y) = (1 --φ~up-atm~ -- φ~up-lo~) M~up~ (y--1) + φ~atm-up~ M~atm~
(y--1) + φ~lo-up~ M~lo~ (y--1) (2)*

*M~lo~ (y) = (1-- φ~lo-up~) M~lo~ (y--1) + φ~up-lo~ M~up~ (y--1) (3)*

with

-   *M~atm~(y), M~up~(y), M~lo~(y):* masses of CO~2~ in atmosphere, in a
    quickly mixing reservoir representing the upper level of the ocean
    and the biosphere, and in deep oceans (GtC), respectively, in year
    *y* (GtC)

-   *E(y--1)* = CO~2~ emissions in previous year (GtC)

-   *φ*~ij~, transport rate from reservoir *i* to reservoir *j* (*i, j =
    atm, up, lo*) from year *y-1* to *y*

b\) CH4 accumulation is represented by a so-called single-box model in
which the atmospheric methane concentration obeys the following
equations assuming a constant annual decay rate of the anthropogenic
concentrations ![](media/image393.wmf) (whereas the natural
concentration is assumed in equilibrium):

![](media/image394.wmf)

where

-   *CH4~atm~ , CH4~up~ ,* and *EA~CH4~* are respectively: the
    atmospheric concentration, the natural concentration[^47] (both
    expressed in Mt), and the anthropogenic emission of CH~4~ (expressed
    in Mt/yr). *EA~CH4~* is generated within the model, but *CH4~up~* is
    fully exogenous (see values for CH4-UP and CH4-ATM in Table A-2).
    All quantities are indexed by year.

-   *d~CH4~ =2.84* (the density of *CH4,* expressed in *Mt/ppbv*) is
    then used to convert concentration in Mt into ppbv.

-   ![](media/image395.wmf) is the one-year retention rate of CH~4~ in
    the atmosphere, see Table A-1.

c\) N2O accumulation is also represented by a single-box model in which
the atmospheric N2O concentration obeys the following equations:

![](media/image396.wmf)

where

-   *N2O~atm~ , N2O~up~ ,* and *EA~N2O\ ~*, are respectively: the
    atmospheric concentration, the natural concentration (both expressed
    in Mt), and the anthropogenic emission of N~2~O (expressed in
    Mt/yr). *EA~N2O~* is generated within the model, but *N2O~up~* is
    fully exogenous (see values for N2O-UP and N2O-ATM in Table A-2).
    All quantities are indexed by year,

-   *d~N2O~* = 7.81 (the density of *N2O,* expressed in *Mt/ppbv*) is
    then used to convert concentration in Mt to ppbv units.

-   ![](media/image397.wmf) is the one-year retention rate of N~2~O in
    the atmosphere, see table A-1.

> *Note*: For both CH~4~ and N~2~O, the total atmospheric concentrations
> (UP+ATM) are used in the forcing expressions (see below) and are
> reported in the results.

######## Radiative forcing

We assume, as is routinely done in atmospheric science, that the
atmospheric radiative forcing caused by the various gases are additive
(IPCC, 2007). Thus:

![](media/image398.wmf)

We now explain these four terms.

a\) The relationship between CO2 accumulation and increased radiative
forcing, *∆F~CO2~(y)*, is derived from empirical measurements and
climate models (IPCC 2007).

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *∆F~CO2~(y) = γ ×* ![](media/image399.wmf)                        (4a)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------- ------

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table D-1*.* Switches

where:

-   M~0~ (i.e.CO2ATM_PRE_IND) is the pre-industrial (circa 1750)
    reference atmospheric concentration of CO2 = 596.4 GtC

-   *γ* is the radiative forcing sensitivity to atmospheric CO~2~
    concentration doubling = 3.7 W/m^2^

b)  The radiative forcing due to atmospheric CH4 is given by the
    following expression (IPCC, 2001)

> ![](media/image400.wmf)

c)  The radiative forcing due to atmospheric N2O is given by the
    following expression (IPCC, 2001)

> ![](media/image401.wmf)
>
> where:

> forcing of the presence in the atmosphere of both gases (CH4 and N2O),
> is not quite symmetrical in the two gases. As usual, the 0 subscript
> indicates the pre-industrial times (1750)

d)  *EXOFOR(y)* is the increase in total radiative forcing at period *t*
    relative to pre-industrial level due to GHGs that are not
    represented explicitly in the model. Units = W/m^2^. In Nordhaus and
    Boyer (1999), only emissions of CO~2~ were explicitly modeled, and
    therefore O(y) accounted for all other GHG's. In TIMES, N~2~O and
    CH~4~ are fully accounted for, but some other substances are not
    (e.g. CFC's, aerosols, ozone, etc.). Therefore, our values for
    *EXOFOR(y)* will differ from those in Nordhaus and Boyer. It is the
    modeler's responsibility to include in the calculation of
    *EXOFOR(y)* only the forcings from those gases and other causes that
    are not modeled. Table A-3 shows a possible trajectory for EXOFOR.

The parameterization of the three forcing equations (4a, 4b, 4c) is not
controversial and relies on the results reported by Working Group I in
the IPCC. IPCC (2001, Table 6.2, p.358) provides a value of 3.7 for γ,
smaller than the one used by Nordhaus and Boyer (γ = 4.1). We have
adopted this lower value of 3.7 W/m^2^ as default in TIMES. Users are
free to experiment with other values of the γ parameter. The same
reference provides the entire expressions for all three forcing
equations.

######## Linear approximations

In TIMES, each of the three forcing expressions is replaced by a linear
approximation, in order to preserve linearity of the entire model. All
three forcing expressions (4a, 4b, 4c) happen to be concave functions.
Therefore, two linear approximations are obvious candidates. The first
one is an approximation from below, consisting of the chord of the graph
between two selected points. The second one has the same slope as the
chord and is tangent to the graph, thus approximating the function from
above. The final approximation is taken to be the arithmetic average of
the two approximations. These linear expressions are easily derived once
a range of interest is defined by the user.

As an example, we derive below the linear approximation for the CO2
forcing expression. The other approximations are obtained in a similar
manner, and the parameters of the linear approximations are shown in the
next section.

***Linear approximation for the CO2 forcing expression***:

First, an interval of interest for the concentration M must be selected
by the user. The interval should be wide enough to accommodate the
anticipated values of the concentrations, but not so wide as to make the
approximation inaccurate. We denote the interval (M~1~,M~2~).

> Next, the linear forcing equation is taken as the half sum of two
> linear expressions, which respectively underestimate and overestimate
> the exact forcing value. The underestimate consists of the chord of
> the logarithmic curve, whereas the overestimate consists of the
> tangent to the logarithmic curve that is parallel to the chord.
>
> By denoting the pre-industrial concentration level as *M~0~*, the
> general formulas for the two estimates are as follows:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Overestimate:*    ![](media/image403.wmf)                           \(5\)
  ------------------ ------------------------------------------------- -------
  *Underestimate*:   ![](media/image404.wmf)                           \(6\)

  *Final             ![](media/image405.wmf)                           \(7\)
  approximation*:

######## Temperature increase

In the TIMES Climate Module as in many other integrated models, climate
change is represented by the global mean surface temperature. The idea
behind the two-reservoir model is that a higher radiative forcing warms
the atmospheric layer, which then quickly warms the upper ocean. In this
model, the atmosphere and upper ocean form a single layer, which slowly
warms the second layer consisting of the deep ocean.

Δ*T~up~(y) =* Δ*T~up~(y-1) +* σ~1~*{* *F(y) --* λ Δ*T~up~(y-1) --* σ~2~
*\[*Δ*T~up~(y-1) --* Δ*T~low~(y-1)\]} (8)*

Δ*T~low~(y) =* Δ*T~low~(y-1) +* σ~3~ *\[*Δ*T~up~(y-1) --* Δ*T~low~
(y-1)\] (9)*

with

-   ΔT~up~ = globally averaged surface temperature increase above
    pre-industrial level,

-   ΔT~low~ = deep-ocean temperature increase above pre-industrial
    level,

-   σ~1~ = 1-year speed of adjustment parameter for atmospheric
    temperature (also known as the *lag* parameter),

-   σ~2~ = coefficient of heat loss from atmosphere to deep oceans,

-   σ~3~ = 1-year coefficient of heat gain by deep oceans,

-   λ = feedback parameter (climatic retroaction). It is customary to
    write λ as λ* =γ*/C~s~, C~s~ being the *climate sensitivity*
    parameter, defined as the change in equilibrium atmospheric
    temperature induced by a doubling of CO~2~ concentration.

[Remark]{.underline}: in contrast with most other parameters, the value
of C~s~ is highly uncertain, with a possible range of values from 1^o^C
to 10^o^C. This parameter is therefore a prime candidate for sensitivity
analysis, or for treatment by probabilistic methods such as stochastic
programming. In Table A-2, a best estimate value of 2.9 ^o^C is shown,
as per IPCC (2001, 2007).

In the next section we describe all the input parameters required to
define the climate equations and those needed to define climate
constraints. With few exceptions (such as the densities of the gases),
all parameters are modifiable by the user, should the need arise. We
also provide Table A-2 summarizing the default values of the parameters.

####### Switches and Parameters

######## Activating the Climate Module

The Climate Module (CLI) extension of TIMES can be activated and
employed by using the Parameters and Switches described in this chapter.

Besides the basic input data parameters described in Table A-1, the user
also has full control over the CLI component being activated by means of
the \$SET CLI YES switch. This switch is provided by the data handling
system when the user indicates that the CLI option is to be included:

> \$SET CLI YES

######## Calibration

The calibration of the Climate Module to historical values is an
important aspect of using the module. The mass balance and temperature
equations can be calibrated for the first period by using three
alternative calibration years B(1)--1, m(1)--1, and m(1). Whenever
D(1)=1, the first two alternatives are equal. The default calibrating
year is m(1)--1. The alternative calibration years can be activated by
using one of the following two settings in the run-file:

> \$SET CM_CALIB B ! Calibrate at the end of B(1)--1
>
> \$SET CM_CALIB M ! Calibrate at the end of m(1)

######## Controlling the years considered beyond EOH

########  {#section-3 .unnumbered}

The Climate Equations will be calculated beyond EOH at each of the years
for which either a user-defined emission target or a temperature or
concentration bound is specified. The years considered thus span between
the EOH and the last year for which a CM_MAXC is specified.

In addition, by default any Climate Equations beyond EOH will be
calculated only at each year having a year value divisible by 20. This
default year resolution can be changed by using the Climate Module
constant **\'BEOHMOD\'**. However, note that the years available in the
model extend by default to 2200 only, and therefore one may need to
adjust the year-span e.g. to 2300 by using the following switch:

> \$SET EOTIME 2300

The **reporting years** for the climate variables are the same as the
calculation years.

######## Input parameters

Like all other aspects of TIMES, the user defines the Climate Module
components of the energy system by means of input parameters, which are
described in this section. Table A-1 below describes the User Input
Parameters that are associated with the Climate Module option.

######### Mapping of regional emissions to global emissions

Conversion from regional emissions to global emissions must be done by
using the CM_GHGMAP(r,c,cg) parameter, in adequate units. The labels for
the global emissions **cg** are \'CO2-GtC\', \'CH4-Mt\' and \'N2O-Mt\'.
The parameter IRE_CCVT(r,c,r,cg) can alternatively be also used, if
CM_GHGMAP is not available.

Assuming here that the total regional emissions are represented by the
commodities TOTCO2, TOTCH4 and TOTN2O, and are measured in kt, as is the
case in TIAM models for instance, the mapping and conversion would be
the following:

> CM_GHGMAP(R,\'TOTCH4\',\'CH4-MT\') = 1E-3;
>
> CM_GHGMAP(R,\'TOTN2O\',\'N2O-MT\') = 1E-3;
>
> CM_GHGMAP(R,\'TOTCO2\',\'CO2-GtC\') = 2.727272 E-7

######### Deterministic input parameters for CO~2~

-   CM_CONST({PHI_AT_UP, PHI_UP_AT, PHI_UP_LO, PHI_LO_UP}) (also denoted
    *φ~atm-up~*, *φ~up-atm~*, etc, in the equations of section 2):
    annual CO~2~ flow coefficients between the three reservoirs
    (AT=Atmosphere, UP=Upper ocean layer, LO=Deep ocean layer). These
    are time-independent coefficients. Units: none

-   CM_HISTORY(y,{CO2-ATM, CO2-UP, CO2-LO}): Values at the end of the
    calibration year *y* of the masses of CO~2~ in the atmosphere, the
    upper ocean layer, and the deep ocean layer, respectively. Note that
    these values are time- indexed so that the model generator can pick
    up the correct value according to the calibration year chosen by the
    user. Units: GtC, Mt(CH4), Mt(N2O).

-   CM_CONST(CO2-PREIND): Pre-industrial atmospheric mass of CO2. Units
    = GtC

######### Parameters for the linear CO~2~ forcing approximation

CM_LINFOR(datayear,item,lim): lower and upper limit for the
concentration of CO~2~ in atmosphere, used in the approximation of the
radiative forcing equation for CO~2~ (see section 2.2 above). *item* may
be equal to CO2-ATM (in which case the limit is expressed as a ratio of
concentration over pre-industrial concentration), or to CO2-PPM (in
which case the limit is expressed in ppm of CO2-equivalent). The index
*lim* is either equal to LO or to UP, depending on whether the lower or
the upper limit of the range is being specified. For example, the
following specifications may be used to select a range from 375 to 550
ppm for the approximation at year 2020:

-   CM_LINFOR(\'2020\', \'CO2-PPM\', \'LO\') = 375;

-   CM_LINFOR(\'2020\', \'CO2-PPM\', \'UP\') = 550;

Note that the values of LINFOR are systematically interpolated. The
range can also be specified in a time-dependent manner taking into
account the gradual increase in the expected range of possible
concentration levels over time. That would further improve the accuracy
of the linearization. For example, for 2005 the range could be specified
to consist of only a single value, because the actual concentration in
2005 is well-known.

######### Parameters for modeling the concentrations and forcings of other greenhouse gases

######### Parameters for the temperature equations

-   CM_CONST(SIGMA1) (also denoted σ~1~): speed of adjustment parameter
    for atmospheric temperature. 1/σ~1~ represents the thermal capacity
    of the atmospheric + upper ocean layer (W-yr/m^2^/^o^C). Note
    however that when SIGMA1 is assumed stochastic, its multiple values
    are specified via the generic S_CM_CONST parameter described below.

-   CM_CONST(SIGMA2) (also denoted σ~2~): ratio of the thermal capacity
    of the deep oceans to the transfer rate from shallow to deep ocean
    (W/m^2^/^o^C).

-   CM_CONST(SIGMA3) (also denoted σ~3~): 1/σ~3~ is the transfer rate
    (per year) from the upper level of the ocean to the deep ocean (yr
    ^-1^).

-   CM_CONST(GAMMA) (also denoted γ): radiative forcing sensitivity to a
    doubling of the atmospheric CO~2~ concentration. Units: Watts/m^2^.

-   CM_CONST(CS): C~s~, the temperature sensitivity to a doubling of the
    CO~2~ concentration (^o^C).

-   CM_CONST(LAMBDA) (also denoted λ): a feedback parameter,
    representing the equilibrium impact of CO~2~ concentrations doubling
    on climate. λ = γ / C~s~. Note however that when C~s~ is assumed
    stochastic, its multiple values are specified via the generic
    S_CM_CONST parameter described below. If all three of λ, γ and C~s~
    are specified, the user-specified λ is overridden by the derived
    value γ / C~s~.

-   CM_HISTORY(y,{DELTA_ATM, DELTA_LOW}): values at the end of the
    calibration year *y* of the temperature changes (wrt to
    pre-industrial time) in atmosphere and deep layer, respectively.
    Units: ^o^C

######### Upper bounds on climate variables

The following parameters are needed if constraints on some climate
variables are desired. In TIMES, several climate upper bounds may be
specified at any year. These upper bounds are specified via the single
generic parameter CM_MAXC(datayear,item), where *datayear* is the year
at which the bound applies, and *item* may be any of the following nine
choices:

-   CO2-ATM: for bounding the ***ratio*** of GHG concentration to the
    preindustrial concentration (where the pre-industrial concentration
    is defined by CO2-PREIND);

-   CO2-PPM: for bounding the CO2 concentration expressed in ppm;

-   CH4_PPB: for bounding the CH4 concentration expressed in ppbv;

-   N2O-PPB: for bounding the N2O concentration expressed in ppbv;

-   FORCING: for bounding the total atmospheric radiative forcing
    expressed in W/ m^2^. (If this bound or the next one on temperature
    is used, the linearized forcing equation is used rather than the
    exact forcing equation);

-   DELTA-ATM: for bounding the change in global atmospheric temperature
    over pre-industrial temperature, expressed in ^o^C;

-   CO2-GTC: for bounding the global CO2 emissions expressed in GtC;

-   CH4-MT: for bounding the global CH4 emissions expressed in Mt;

-   N2O-MT: for bounding the global N2O emissions expressed in Mt.

In addition, the user can also bound the CO~2~ concentration expressed
in GtC, by using CM_MAXCO2C.

######### Incorporating climate variables in UC constraints

When using the Climate Module extension, one can also refer to the
climate variables in user constraints. The UC attribute for that purpose
is the following:

> UC_CLI(uc_n, side, reg, y, item)

This parameter can be used to define climate variable coefficients in
any period-wise user constraints. The UC_GRPTYPE (to be used in UC_ATTR)
for this parameter is \'CLI\'. The ***item*** index can be any of the
following climate variables:

-   CO2-GTC - total global CO~2~ emissions (or CO~2~-eq. GHGs)

-   CO2-ATM - CO~2~ concentration in the atmosphere

-   CO2-UP - CO~2~ concentration in the biosphere/upper ocean

-   CO2-LO - CO~2~ concentration in the deep ocean layer

-   FORCING - radiative forcing

-   DELTA-ATM - atmospheric temperature

-   DELTA-LO - deep oceanic temperature

The attribute can be used for defining custom relation­ships by each
region, between any of the climate variables and e.g. process flows,
activities or capacities, or total commodity flows. However, if used in
a global constraint, one should normally define the UC_CLI attribute
only for one region (e.g. GLB).

######### Random climate parameters (refer to documentation on stochastic TIMES)

If the stochastic programming version of TIMES is used, several climate
parameters may be assumed random. These fall into two categories: the
upper bounds on climate quantities discussed in the previous section,
and the two climate coefficients, **Cs** and **SIGMA1.**

Regarding the random upper bounds, their multiple values are specified
via the stochastic version of the **CM_MAX** parameter, namely
**S_CM_MAX(datayear,item,stage,sow)**, where in addition to **datayear**
and **item** already explained, **stage** refers to the stage of the
event tree and **sow** refers to the state-of-the-world. Note that this
single generic parameter will be specified as many times as there are
**stages** and **sow**'s in the stochastic event tree. If this parameter
is specified, the corresponding values of the deterministic parameter
**CM_MAX** are superseded.

Regarding the two random coefficients, their multiple values are then
declared via the single generic parameter
**S_CM_CONST(item,stage,sow)**, where **item** may be equal to **CS** or
to **SIGMA1**, **stage** is the stage number, and **sow** is the
state-of-the-world. Note that this single generic parameter will be
specified as many times as there are stages and sow's in the stochastic
event tree. If this parameter is specified, the corresponding values of
the deterministic parameter (**LAMBDA** and/or **SIGMA1**) are
superseded.

The reader is referred to Chapter 8 of Part I and the documentation of
the stochastic programming version of TIMES for the precise meaning of
the **stage** and **sow** concepts.

**Remark:** in addition to the possible values of the random parameters,
the user must specify the probabilities attached to each ***sow***. This
is also explained in the documentation on stochastic TIMES.

######### Parameters for extending the Climate Module equations beyond EOH

The main purpose of extending the climate equations beyond EOH is to be
able to set climate targets beyond EOH. This is particularly useful for
DeltaT targets, because there is a con­siderable time lag between the
decline of emissions and the peak of DeltaT.

The extended climate equations must be explicitly activated by the user.
The activation can be done by specifying any non-negative value for the
new Climate Module constant **CM_CONST**(**\'EXT-EOH\')**. Different
values of the constant will have the following meaning:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Value**   **Meaning**
  ----------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  -1          The feature is deactivated.
  (default)   

  0           In this case **\'EXT-EOH\'** will be automatically adjusted
              to E(*M*), where *M *is the last model year ***m*** for
              which the end-year **E(*m*)** is specified. The adjusted
              parameter will then have the same meaning as in the case
              EXT-EOH \> 0 below.

  \>0         The emissions at EOH will remain constant at the endogenous
              value in EOH=E(T) (where T=last **milestone year**) until
              the year MAX(**EXT-EOH**, EOH), and then develop linearly
              from that value to the first user-defined emission value in
              a subsequent year.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Table D-4*.* Linear CES demand function example

The setting **EXT-EOH**=**0** may be useful for ensuring that any
user-defined target values for the emissions will only be taken into
account beyond the last ***model year***, even in model runs where a
truncated model horizon is used. In such case, when **EXT-EOH**=**0** is
used, the emissions are assumed to remain constant between the truncated
EOH and the end of the full model horizon.

A positive value **EXT-EOH**=**y** **≤ EOH** means that a linear
development of emissions towards the first user-defined value is
requested to start im­mediately at the EOH, regardless of the model
horizon being truncated or not. Finally, a positive value
**EXT-EOH**=**y** **\> EOH** can be useful if the user wishes the
emissions to remain constant at the EOH value until a predefined year
y \> EOH, before turning into the linear development towards the first
user-defined value.

**[Warning]{.underline}**: If **0 \< EXT-EOH \< E(M) = MAX~m~(E(m))**,
any user-defined global emission bounds for CO2-GTC, CH4-MT or N2O-MT,
which may be inadvertently specified at years between **MAX(EXT-EOH,
EOH)** and **E(M)**, will also be taken into account as target values
for the emission trajectories.

The global greenhouse gas emissions that can be considered by the
extended climate equations are the three main input emissions to the
Climate Module:

-   CO2-GTC Global CO2 emissions, expressed in GtC

-   CH4-MT Global CH4 emissions, expressed in Mt

-   N2O-MT Global N2O emissions, expressed in Mt

The user can specify target emission values for these emissions at any
year(s) beyond EOH. For simplicity, the target emission values are
specified by using the **CM_MAXC** parameter, which is normally used for
specifying upper bounds for the global emissions, as well as for the
temperature and concentrations.

Starting from the year ***B***= MAX(EOH,EXT-EOH), the emissions will be
assumed to develop linearly from the value at EOH to the first
user-specified value beyond ***B***. If no target values are specified,
the emissions will be assumed to remain constant at the EOH value. If
several successive values are speci­fied, the emissions will develop
linearly also between the successive target values.

Bounds on the global atmospheric temperature, forcing or GHG
con­cen­trations can be specified at any years beyond the EOH, in the
normal way. In addition, exogenous forcing can be specified and is
interpolated beyond EOH.

The Climate Equations will be calculated beyond EOH at each of the years
for which either a user-defined emission target or a temperature or
concentration bound is specified. The years considered thus span between
the EOH and the last year for which a CM_MAXC is specified. However, as
described above, any emission bounds between EOH and MAX(EOH,EXT-EOH)
will be ignored.

In addition, by default the Climate Equations will be calculated also at
each year having a year value divisible by 20. This default year
resolution can be changed by using the new Climate Module constant
**\'BEOHMOD\'**. Accordingly, if the user wishes the Climate Equations
to be calculated at 10 years' intervals (in addition to the CM_MAXC
years) she can specify the following parameter:

> **PARAMETER CM_CONST / BEOHMOD 10 /;**

The **reporting years** for the climate variables are the same as the
calculation years.

######## Internal parameters

-   *CM_PPM~cm_var~*: The densities of the greenhouse gases are hard
    coded in TIMES (via the internal parameter), with the following
    values:

> density of CH~4~ : 2.84 Mt / ppbv
>
> density of N~2~O : 7.81 Mt / ppbv
>
> density of CO~2~ : 2.13 Gt / ppm.

-   *CM_PHI~cm_var,t,i,j~*: The transition matrix for climate indicator
    cm_var between reservoirs i and j and successive years t--1 and t;

-   *CM_AA~cm_var,t,i,j~*: The transition matrix for climate indicator
    cm_var between reservoirs i and j and between the milestone years of
    periods t--1 and t;

-   *CM_BB~cm_var,t,i,j~*: The transition matrix for climate indicator
    cm_var from emissions in period t to reservoir contents in the same
    period;

-   *CM_CC~cm_var,t,i,j~*: The transition matrix for climate indicator
    cm_var from emissions in period t--1 to reservoir contents in the
    period t.

######## Reporting parameters

There are two reporting parameters, CM_RESULT and CM_MAXC_M, which
contain the results on the levels of the climate variables (or reporting
quantities) and the dual values of the constraints defined by using
CM_MAXC.

CM_RESULT is indexed by year *y* and result type {e.g. CO2-ATM, CO2-PPM,
FORCING, DELTA-ATM, DELTA_LO}. The values represent the quantities at
the end of year y. The reporting years y include the milestone years
plus any years beyond m(T) that either have some CM_MAXC bound defined
or are modulo(BEOHMOD).

-   CO2-GtC(y): the total global CO2 emissions at the end of year **y**.

-   CO2-ATM(y): the value of the atmospheric mass of CO2-equivalent at
    the end of year **y**, obtained directly from the variable
    **VAR_CLIBOX(\'CO2-ATM\',y)**.

-   CO2-PPM(y): the value of the atmospheric concentration of
    CO2-equivalent at the end of year **y**.

-   FORCING(y): forcing value at end of year y, calculated using the
    linearized forcing functions as defined by the user.

-   FORC+TOT(y): exact forcing value at end of year y, calculated using
    the logarithmic forcing equation defined in section 2.2 and the
    CO2-ATM(y) value.

-   DELTA_ATM(y): exact atmospheric temperature value at end of year y,
    calculated using the forcing FORC+TOT(y).

-   DELTA_LOW(y): exact lower ocean temperature value at end of year y,
    calculated using the forcing FORC+TOT(y).

CM_MAXC_M is indexed by year *y* and constraint type. The values are
reported for each of the EQ_CLITOT and EQ_CLIMAX equations. The values
represent directly the dual values of these constraints at year y.

####### Variables

The variables that are used in the Climate Module in TIMES are presented
in below. The climate indicators represented in the Climate Module are
grouped according to the following internal sets, which are referred to
in the GAMS formulation, presented in Section 5:

-   **cm_var**: the set of all climate indicators

-   **cm_tkind**: aggregate total indicators (CO2-GtC, CH4-Mt, N2O-Mt,
    FORCING)

-   **cm_emis**: emission indicators (CO2-GtC, CH4-Mt, N2O-Mt)

-   **cm_boxmap~tkind,cm_var,cm_box~**: mapping between aggregate
    indicators tkind, reservoir indicators cm_var, and corresponding box
    labels (ATM/UP/LO);

-   **cm_atmap~tkind,cm_var~**: mapping between aggregate indicators
    *tkind* and the corresponding boundable atmospheric indicators
    (CO2-PPM / CH4-PPM / N2O-PPM / DELTA_ATM);

-   **cm_atbox ~tkind,cm_box~**: mapping between mapping between
    aggregate emission indicators *tkind* and the corresponding
    reservoirs that comprise the atmospheric concentration part;
    contains the pairs {(CO2-GtC,ATM),\
    (CH4-Mt,ATM),(CH4-Mt,UP),(N2O-Mt,ATM),(N2O-Mt,UP) }

######## VAR_CLITOT(cm_var,y)

**Description:** The total amount of aggregate climate indicator in year
y.

**Purpose and** This variable tracks the total amount of an aggregate
climate indicator by

**Occurrence:** period. This variable is generated for each main
emission type of the Climate Module as well as for the total forcing
from all greenhouse gas concentrations.

**Units:** GtC (for CO2 emissions), Mt (for CH4 and N2O emissions), or
W/m2 (for total radiative forcing).

**Bounds:** This variable can be directly bounded with the CM_MAXC
attribute.

######## VAR_CLIBOX(cm_var,y)

**Description:** The amount of climate indicator in a reservoir.

**Purpose and** This variable tracks the amount of reservoir-specific
climate indicator by **Occurrence:** period. This variable is generated
for each of the reservoirs for each of the aggregate indicators:
ATM/UP/LO for CO2 emissions, ATM/UP for CH4 and N2O emissions, and
ATM/LO for FORCING (connected to the temperature reservoirs).

**Units:** GtC (for CO2 emissions), Mt (for CH4 and N2O emissions), or
°C (for temperature reservoirs).

**Bounds:** Only the total atmospheric amounts can be bounded with the
CM_MAXC attribute (CO2-ATM, CO2-PPM, CH4-PPB, N2O-PPB, DELTA-ATM).

####### Equations

There are three blocks of definitional equations: the first block of
equations calculates the global emissions of GHG (either all in CO~2~
eq., or separately for CO~2~, CH~4~ and N~2~O) as well as the total
(linearized) radiative forcing, the next block calculates the
concentrations of the greenhouse gases in the reservoirs, and the third
block calculates the atmospheric temperature and lower ocean temperature
at period t.

In addition, there is a generic block of equations expressing the upper
bounding of the five climate quantities discussed in subsection 3.4.6.
This generic equation is generated as many times as an upper bound on

######  Damage Cost Functions

####### Introduction

This Appendix contains the documentation on the Damage Cost Function
extensions for the TIMES model. The chapter contains 6 sections: section
2 contains the mathematical formulation, section 3 describes the
parameters for the Damage Cost Functions, and section 4 gives two
examples. Finally, section 5 describes the variables and section 6
describes the equations.

The Damage Cost Function option of TIMES is intended for modelers who
wish to evaluate the environmental externalities caused by an energy
system. For instance, emissions of toxic or environmentally harmful
pollutants from the energy system create social costs linked to impacts
of the pollution on human health and the environment. In another
example, in global studies of GHG emissions, it may be of interest to
evaluate the impact of GHG emissions on concentrations and ultimately on
damages created by climate change induced by increased concentration of
GHGs.

Until recently, in most studies involving bottom-up models, emission
externalities have been modeled in one of two ways: either by
introducing an emission tax, or by imposing emission caps. In the first
case, the tax is (ideally) supposed to represent the external cost
created by one unit of emission. However, using a tax assumes that the
cost is a linear function of emissions. In the second approach, it is
assumed that such a cost is unknown but that exogenous studies (or
regulations, treaties, etc.) have defined a level of acceptable
emissions that should not be exceeded. However, using this approach is
akin to making the implicit assumption that emissions in excess of the
cap have an infinite external cost. Both of these approaches have merit
and have been successfully applied to many energy system model studies.

It is however possible to extend these two approaches by introducing an
option to better model the cost of damages created by emissions. The
damage function option discussed in this document extends the concept of
an emission tax by modeling more accurately the assumed cost of damages
due to emissions of a pollutant.

####### Mathematical formulation

We now describe the mathematical formulation used for the damage cost
functions.

With respect to optimization, two distinct approaches to account for
damage costs can be distinguished:

1.  Environmental damages are computed ex-post, without feedback into
    > the optimization process, and

2.  Environmental damages are part of the objective function and
    therefore taken into account in the optimization process.

In both approaches, a number of assumptions are made:

-   Emissions in each region may be assumed to cause damage only in the
    > same region or, due to trans-boundary pollution, also in other
    > regions; however, all damage costs are allocated to the polluters
    > in the source region, in accordance with the Polluter Pays
    > Principle, or Extended Polluter Responsibility;

-   Damages in a given time period are linked to emissions in that same
    > period only (damages are not delayed, nor are they cumulative);
    > and

-   Damages due to several pollutants are the sum of damages due to each
    pollutant (no cross impacts).

In a given time period, and for a given pollutant, the damage cost is
modeled as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image426.wmf)                                        \(1\)
  -------------------------------------------------------------- --------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

where:

-   EM is the emission in the current period;

-   DAM is the damage cost in the current period;

-   *β* ≥ 0 is the elasticity of marginal damage cost to amount of
    > emissions; and

-   *α* \> 0 is a calibrating parameter, which may be obtained from
    dose-response studies that allow the computation of the marginal
    damage cost per unit of emission at some reference level of
    emissions.

If we denote the marginal cost at the reference level MC~0~, the
following holds:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image427.wmf)                                        \(2\)
  -------------------------------------------------------------- --------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

where EM~0~ is the reference amount of emissions. Therefore expression
(1) may be re-written as:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image428.wmf)                                        \(3\)
  -------------------------------------------------------------- --------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The marginal damage cost is therefore given by the following expression:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image429.wmf)                                        \(4\)
  -------------------------------------------------------------- --------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The approach to damage costs described in this section applies more
particularly to local pollutants. Extension to global emissions such GHG
emissions requires the use of a global TIMES model and a
reinterpretation of the equations discussed above.

The modeling of damage costs via equation (3) introduces a non-linear
term in the objective function if the ***β*** parameter is strictly
larger than zero. This in turn requires that the model be solved via a
Non-Linear Programming (NLP) algorithm rather than a LP algorithm.
However, the resulting Non-Linear Program remains convex as long as the
elasticity parameter is equal to or larger than zero. For additional
details on convex programming, see Nemhauser et al (1989). If linearity
is desired (for instance if problem instances are very large), we can
approximate expression (3) by a sequence of linear segments with
increasing slopes, and thus obtain a Linear Program.

The linearization can be done by choosing a suitable range of emissions,
and dividing that range into *m* intervals below the reference level,
and *n* intervals above the reference level. We also assume a middle
interval centered at the reference emission level. To each interval
corresponds one step variable *S*. Thus, we have for emissions:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image430.wmf)                                        \(5\)
  -------------------------------------------------------------- --------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The damage cost can then be written as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image431.wmf)                                        \(6\)
  -------------------------------------------------------------- --------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

where:

-   ![](media/image432.wmf)are the approximate marginal costs at each
    > step below and above the reference level as shown in (7) below;
    > and

-   ![](media/image433.wmf)are the non-negative step variables for
    emissions. Apart from the final step, each step variable has an
    upper bound equal to the width of the interval. In this formulation
    we choose intervals of uniform width on each side of the reference
    level. However, the intervals below and above the reference level
    can have different sizes. The width of the middle interval is always
    the average of the widths below and above the reference level.

The approximate marginal costs at each step can be assumed to be the
marginal costs at the center of each step. If all the steps intervals
are of equal size, the marginal costs for the steps below the reference
level are obtained by the following formula:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image434.wmf)                                        \(7\)
  -------------------------------------------------------------- --------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Formulas for the marginal costs of the other steps can be derived
similarly.

The TIMES implementation basically follows the equations shown above.
Both the non-linear and linearized approaches can be used. However, in
order to provide some additional flexibility, the implementation
supports also defining a threshold level of emissions, below which the
damage costs are zero. This refinement can be taken into account in the
balance equation (5) by adding one additional step variable having an
upper bound equal to the threshold level, and by adjusting the widths of
the other steps accordingly. The threshold level can also easily be
taken into account in the formulas for the approximate marginal costs.

In addition, the implementation supports different elasticities and step
sizes to be used below and above the reference level. See Section 3 for
more details.

####### Switches and Parameters

######## Activating the Damage Cost Functions

Like all other aspects of TIMES, the user describes the Damage Cost
Functions by means of a Set and the Parameters and Switches described in
this chapter.

As discussed in Section 2, the TIMES Damage Cost Function facility
permits the assessment of environmental externalities by means of two
approaches to determine the impact or cost of damages arising from
emissions: ex-post calculation and internalized damage costs. The second
approach can be further divided into the non-linear and linear
formulations, and therefore the following three approaches are available
in Standard TIMES:

1.  The environmental damages are computed ex-post, without feedback
    into the optimization process;

2.  The environmental damages are a linearized part of the objective
    function and therefore taken into account in the optimization
    process;

3.  The environmental damages are a non-linear part of the objective
    > function and therefore taken into account in the optimization
    > process.

The user can control whether or not the damage costs are activated in
the objective function by means of the switch \$SET DAMAGE LP/NLP/NO.
This switch is provided by the data handling system according to how the
user wishes the option to be included:

> \$SET DAMAGE LP
>
> \$SET DAMAGE NLP
>
> \$SET DAMAGE NO

The setting \$SET DAMAGE LP is the default, and activates the linearized
formulation of damage costs, with the costs included in the objective
function. The setting \$SET DAMAGE NLP activates the non-linear damage
cost option, with the costs included in the objective function. The
setting \$SET DAMAGE NO causes the damage costs only to be computed
ex-post, without feedback into the optimization process.

Note that owing to the non-linear nature of the modified objective
function that endogenizes the damages, the NLP damage option requires
non-linear solution methods that can lead to much larger resource
utilization compared to LP models. In addition, the options with an
augmented objective function cannot be currently activated with the
non-linear TIMES-MACRO model variant. However, the linear option LP can
be used together with the decomposed MACRO_MSA option.

######## Input parameters

All the parameters for describing damage functions are available in the
VEDA-FE shell, where they may be specified. All parameters have a prefix
\'DAM\_\' in the GAMS code of the model generator. The parameters are
discussed in more detail below:

1.  The parameter **DAM_COST** is used to specify the marginal damage
    cost at the reference level of emissions. The parameter has a year
    index, which can be utilized also for turning damage accounting
    on/off for an emission in a period (by specifying an EPS value for
    the cost). **DAM_COST** is interpolated/extrapolated by default, but
    unlike other cost parameters, the interpolation is sparse, and the
    costs are assumed to be constant within each period.

2.  The parameter **DAM_BQTY** is used to specify the reference level of
    emissions. If not specified or set to zero, the marginal damage
    costs will be assumed constant, and no emission steps are used.

3.  The parameter **DAM_ELAST** is used to specify the elasticity of
    marginal damage costs to emissions in the lower and upper direction.
    If specified in one direction only, the elasticity is assumed in
    both directions. If neither is specified, the marginal damage costs
    will be constant in both directions.

4.  The parameter **DAM_STEP** can be used for specifying the number of
    emission steps below and above the reference level of emissions. The
    last step above the reference level will always have an infinite
    bound. If the number of steps is not provided in either direction,
    but the elasticity is, one step is assumed in that direction. If a
    non-zero **DAM_STEP**(r,c,\'N\') is specified, the damage costs for
    commodity **c** in region **r** are not included in the objective.
    If the NLP formulation is used (DAMAGE=NLP), all **DAM_STEP**
    parameters will be ignored.

5.  The parameter **DAM_VOC** can be used for specifying the variation
    in emissions covered by the emission steps, both in the lower an
    upper direction. The variation in the lower direction should be less
    than or equal to the reference level of emissions. If the lower
    variation is smaller than **DAM_BQTY**, the damage costs.

The input parameters are listed in Table .

######## Reporting parameters

There is only one reporting parameter specifically related to the Damage
Cost functions. The parameter represents the undiscounted damage costs
by region, period and emission commodity. The parameter has two
flavours; the first one is for standard TIMES and the second one for
stochastic TIMES:

-   **CST_DAM(r,t,c)**: Annual damage costs from emission **c** in
    region **r**,

-   **SCST_DAM(w,r,t,c)**: Annual damage costs from emission **c** in
    region **r** and stochastic scenario **w**.

However, in addition the standard reporting parameters REG_WOBJ, and
REG_ACOST are augmented with damage costs results, using the label
\'DAM\'/\'DAM-EXT\' to distinguish damage costs from other cost
components.

These parameters are included in the .vdd files that describe the
parameters to be transferred to VEDA-BE under standard TIMES and
stochastic TIMES. Therefore, the corresponding result parameter is
always available in VEDA-BE whenever Damage Cost functions have been
defined, even with the setting DAMAGE=NO.

The damage costs are always reported by using the accurate non-linear
expressions, even if the linearized formulation is chosen for the
augmented objective function.

####### Examples

Assume that we wish to define linearized damage costs for the emission
commodity \'EM\' so that the cost function has the following properties:

-   The reference level of emissions is 80 units;

-   The marginal cost at the reference level are 10 cost units per
    > emission unit;

-   The cost elasticity is 1 in the lower direction, and 0.7 in the
    > upper direction;

The damage function can be specified with the following parameters:

PARAMETER DAM_COST / REG.2000.EM.CUR 10 /;

PARAMETER DAM_BQTY / REG.EM 80 /;

PARAMETER DAM_ELAST / REG.EM.LO 1, REG.EM.UP 0.7 /;

![](media/image435.wmf)

Figure

 15. Example of a linearized damage function with 1+1+1 steps\
(1 lower step, 1 middle step, 1 upper step).

As we did not specify the number of steps, but we did specify the
elasticities in both directions, the number of steps is assumed to be 1
in both directions. The resulting damage cost function is illustrated in
Figure . Because the damage function has a very coarse representation,
the total costs have notable deviations from the accurate non-linear
function. Note that the step size has been automatically determined to
be **DAM_BQTY/(DAM_STEP+0.5)** = 80/1.5. However, the last step has no
upper bound.

Assume next that we would like to refine the damage function by the
following specifications:

-   We want to have 5 steps below the reference, and 3 steps above it;

-   The threshold level of damage costs is 20 units of emissions;

-   The steps above the reference level should cover 100 units of
    emissions.

The damage function can be specified with the following parameters

PARAMETER DAM_COST / REG.2000.EM.CUR 10 /;

PARAMETER DAM_BQTY / REG.EM 80 /;

PARAMETER DAM_ELAST / REG.EM.LO 1, REG.EM.UP 0.7 /;

PARAMETER DAM_STEP / REG.EM.LO 5, REG.EM.UP 3 /;

PARAMETER DAM_VOC / REG.EM.LO 60, REG.EM.UP 100 /;

The resulting damage cost function is illustrated in Figure . The cost
function follows now very closely the accurate non-linear function. Note
that the step sizes derived from the VOC specifications are 10 units for
the lower steps, 20 for the middle step, and 30 units for the upper
steps. However, the last step of course has no upper bound.

Figure

 B-16. Example of a linearized damage function with 1+5+1+3 steps\
(one zero cost step, 5 lower steps, one middle step, 3 upper steps).

####### Variables

There are only two sets of new variables in the damage cost formulation,
VAR_DAM and VAR_OBJDAM, which are shown below in . The variables VAR_DAM
represent the steps in the emissions in each period. In the linearized
formulation, there are DAM_STEP(\...,\'LO\') number of step variables on
the lower side and DAM_STEP(\...\'UP\') number of step variables on the
higher side of emissions. In addition, one step variable of type \'FX\'
corresponds to the middle step that includes the reference level of
emissions, and an optional additional step variable of type \'FX\'
corresponds to the zero-damage fraction of emissions, as defined by the
difference between DAM_BQTY(..) and DAM_VOC(\...,\'LO\').

The variables VAR_OBJDAM represent the total discounted damage costs by
region. The undiscounted costs in each period described in Section 2 are
discounted and summed over all periods and emissions in each region. As
emissions are in TIMES assumed to be constant within each period, damage
costs are likewise assumed to be constant within each period.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Variable           **Variable Description**
  (Indexes)**          
  -------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  VAR_DAM\             The emission step variable for the damage function of
  (r,t,c,bd,j)         commodity **c** in region **r**, for each step **j** in
                       each direction **bd**.

  VAR_OBJ\             The variable is equal to the sum of the total discounted
  (r,\'OBJDAM\',cur)   damage costs in each region **r** with currency **cur**.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

######## VAR_DAMAGE(r,t,c,bd,j)

**Description:** The amount of emission indicator **c** at cost step
**j** in direction **bd**, in period **t**.

**Purpose:** This variable tracks the amount of an emission indicator by
cost step and period, in both the lower and upper direction from the
reference level.

**Occurrence:** The variable is generated for emission indicator that
has damage costs specified, whenever the damage cost functions are
included in the objective function.

**Units:** Units of the emission commodity **c**.

**Bounds:** This variable cannot be directly bounded by the user.

######## VAR_OBJ(r,\'OBJDAM\',cur)

**Description:** The total present value of damage costs by region.

**Purpose:** This variable is included in the objective function in
order to include damage costs in the objective when requested by the
user.

**Occurrence:** This variable is generated for each region when damage
cost functions are included in the objective function

**Units:** Currency units used for damage functions.

**Bounds:** This variable cannot be directly bounded by the user.

####### Equations

There are two blocks of equations generated for damage cost functions,
whenever they are included in the objective function. The two equations
related to the damage functions are listed and briefly described below
in . The equations include the balance of stepped emissions, the
objective component for damage costs, and the augmented total objective
function.

In addition, the standard TIMES objective function, **EQ_OBJ**, is
augmented by the present value of the damage costs, as defined by the
equation EQ_OBJDAM.

We now give the formulations of these constraints.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Constraints   **Constraint Description**
  (Indexes)**     
  --------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  EQ_DAMAGE\      The balance equation between the stepped emission
  (r,t,c)         variables and the total emissions in each period.

  EQ_OBJDAM\      The total discounted damage costs by region, which will
  (r,cur)         be added as a component to the objective function.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

######## EQ_DAMAGE(r,t,c)

**Description:** Allocates the total amount of emission indicator in
period **t** to cost steps.

**Purpose:** This constraint allocates the total amount of emission
indicator c to the cost steps of the linearized / non-linear damage cost
functions in each period ***t***.

> This equation is generated in each time period for all emission
> indicators considered.

**Units:** Units of the emission commodity **c**.

**Type:** *Binding.* The equation is an equality (=) constraint.

**Remarks**:

-   The damage costs can be defined either on the net production
    (VAR_COMNET) or the gross production (VAR_COMPRD) of the
    commodity c. By default the damage costs are applied to the NET
    amount, unless *DAM_ELAST~r,c,\'N\'~* is also specified.
    *DAM_ELAST~r,c,\'N\'~* defines a multiplier for the Base prices to
    be added to the damage cost function, when it is to be applied to
    the gross production.

-   The internal parameter *DAM_COEF~r,t,c,s~* is set to the base
    prices, if *DAM_ELAST~r,c,\'N\'~* is specified, and otherwise to 1.

**Equation:**

![](media/image438.wmf)

######## EQ_OBJDAM(r,cur)

**Description:** Computes the present value of all damage costs by
region and currency.

**Purpose:** Defines the variable VAR_OBJ(r,\'OBJDAM\',cur), which
represents the total present value of all damage costs in region r,
having currency cur. This variable is included in the TIMES objective
function.

**Units:** Currency units.

**Type:** *Binding.* The equation is an equality (=) constraint.

**Remarks:**

-   The internal parameter *DAM_SIZE~r,c,bd~* represents the sizes of
    cost steps of the dlinearized damage cost function, for both
    directions (bd=LO/UP) and for the middle step (bd=FX), as described
    above in Section .

######  Endogenous Technological Learning (ETL)

####### Introduction

As discussed in Chapter 11 of Part I, there are situations in which the
rate at which a technology's unit investment cost changes over time is a
function of cumulative investment in the technology. In these
situations, technological learning is called endogenous.

Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) is employed in order to model Endogenous
Technological Learning (ETL) in TIMES. As has already been noted in the
case of Lumpy Investments, MIP problems are much more difficult to solve
than standard LP problems, and so the ETL feature should be applied only
where it is deemed necessary to model a limited number of technologies
as candidates for Endogenous Technological Learning. This caution is
especially required for large-scale TIMES instances. Another important
caveat is that ETL is relevant when the modeling scope is broad e.g.
when a large portion of (or perhaps the entire) world energy system is
being modeled, since the technological learning phenomenon rests on
global cumulative capacity of a technology, and not on the capacity
implemented in a small portion of the world.

In this chapter we provide the data and modeling details associated with
modeling Endogenous Technological Learning (ETL) in TIMES. The
implementation of ETL in TIMES is based on the realization in the MARKAL
model generator. The major part of the MARKAL code for ETL could be
transferred to TIMES. Accordingly the description of ETL presented here
follows the MARKAL documentation of ETL. To this end the next three
sections will address the Sets, Parameters, Variables, and Equations
related to the Endogenous Technological Learning option, including the
special clustered learning ETL option where a component common to
several technologies learns, thereby benefiting all the related
(clustered) technologies.

####### Sets, Switches and Parameters

Like all other aspects of TIMES the user describes the ETL components of
the energy system by means of a Set and the Parameters and Switches
described in this chapter. and below describe the User Input Parameters,
and the Matrix Coefficient and Internal Model Sets and Parameters,
respectively, that are associated with the Endogenous Technological
Learning option. Note that the special clustered learning ETL option
requires one additional User Input Parameter (ETL-CLUSTER), and two
additional Matrix Coefficient/Internal Model Parameters (CLUSTER and
NTCHTEG).

Besides the basic data described in the user controls whether or not the
ETL component is activated by means of the \$SET ETL 'YES' switch. This
switch is provided by the data handling system when the user indicates
that the ETL option is to be included in a run. This permits the easy
exclusion of the feature if the user does not want to perform a MIP
solve without having to remove the ETL data.

| ALPH    | I | ALPH are the intercepts on the vertical axis of the    |
|         |   | line segments in the piecewise linear approximation of |
| (r,k,p) |   | the cumulative cost curve. They are calculated in      |
|         |   | COEF_ETL.ETL from the starting and ending points of    |
|         |   | the cumulative cost curve, its assumed form, the       |
|         |   | number of segments used in its piecewise linear        |
|         |   | approximation, and the choice of successive interval   |
|         |   | lengths on the vertical axis to be such that each      |
|         |   | interval is twice as wide as the preceding one. The    |
|         |   | parameter ALPH occurs in the ETL equation EQ_COS that  |
|         |   | defines the piecewise linear approximation to the      |
|         |   | cumulative cost curve.                                 |

| BETA    | I | BETA are the slopes of the line segments in the        |
|         |   | piecewise linear approximation of the cumulative cost  |
| (r,k,p) |   | curve. They are calculated in COEF_ETL.ETL from the    |
|         |   | starting and ending points of the cumulative cost      |
|         |   | curve, its assumed form, the number of segments used   |
|         |   | in its piecewise linear approximation, and the choice  |
|         |   | of successive interval lengths on the vertical axis to |
|         |   | be such that each interval is twice as wide as the     |
|         |   | preceding one. The parameter BETA occurs in the ETL    |
|         |   | equation EQ_COS that defines the piecewise linear      |
|         |   | approximation to the cumulative cost curve.            |
+---------+---+--------------------------------------------------------+
| CCAP0   | A | CCAP0 is the initial cumulative capacity (starting     |
|         |   | point on the learning curve). The parameter CCAP0      |
| (r,p)   |   | occurs in the ETL equation EQ_CUINV that defines       |
|         |   | cumulative capacity in each period.                    |
+---------+---+--------------------------------------------------------+
| CCAPK   | I | CCAPK are the break points on the horizontal axis in   |
|         |   | the piecewise linear approximation of the cumulative   |
| (k,p)   |   | cost curve. They are calculated in COEF_ETL.ETL from   |
|         |   | the starting and ending points of the cumulative cost  |
|         |   | curve, its assumed form, the number of segments used   |
|         |   | in its piecewise linear approximation, and the choice  |
|         |   | of successive interval lengths on the vertical axis to |
|         |   | be such that each interval is twice as wide as the     |
|         |   | preceding one. The parameter CCAPK occurs in the ETL   |
|         |   | equations EQ_LA1 and EQ_LA2 whose role is to ensure    |
|         |   | that variable R_LAMB(r,t,k,p) lies in the k^th^        |
|         |   | interval, i.e., between CCAPK(r,k-1,p) and             |
|         |   | CCAPK(r,k,p), when its associated binary variable      |
|         |   | R_DELTA(r,t,k,p) = 1.                                  |
+---------+---+--------------------------------------------------------+
| CCOST0  | I | CCOST0 is the initial cumulative cost (starting point  |
|         |   | on the learning curve). It is calculated in            |
| (r,p)   |   | COEF_ETL.ETL from the initial cumulative capacity      |
|         |   | (CCAP0) and corresponding initial investment cost      |
|         |   | (user input parameter SC0) and the progress ratio      |
|         |   | (user input parameter PRAT). The parameter CCOST0      |
|         |   | occurs in the ETL equation EQ_IC1 that defines first   |
|         |   | period investment costs (prior to discounting).        |
+---------+---+--------------------------------------------------------+
| SEG     | A | The user input parameter SEG is the number of segments |
|         |   | in the cumulative cost curve. The parameter SEG occurs |
| (r,p)   |   | in all of those ETL equations that are related to the  |
|         |   | piecewise linear approximation of the cumulative cost  |
|         |   | curve.                                                 |

| TEG     | S | TEG is the set of technologies to which endogenous     |
|         |   | technology learning (ETL) applies. Each of the ETL     |

| CLUSTER | I | The user input parameter CLUSTER (cluster mapping and  |
|         |   | coupling factor) is only relevant when modeling        |
| (r,p,p) |   | clustered endogenous technology learning. The          |
|         |   | parameter occurs in the special ETL cluster equation   |
|         |   | EQ_CLU that defines investment in new capacity         |
|         |   | (VAR_NCAP) in the key learning technology as the       |
|         |   | weighted sum of investments in new capacity of the     |
|         |   | clustered technologies that are attached to the key    |
|         |   | technology. (The weights used are the numeric values   |
|         |   | of the CLUSTER parameter.)                             |
+---------+---+--------------------------------------------------------+
| TL_     | I | The user input parameter TL_MRCLUST is only relevant   |
| MRCLUST |   | when modeling clustered endogenous technology          |
|         |   | learning. The parameter occurs in the special ETL      |
| (r,teg  |   | cluster equation EQ_MRCLU that defines investment in   |
| ,reg,p) |   | new capacity (VAR_NCAP) in the key learning technology |
|         |   | as the weighted sum of investments in new capacity of  |
|         |   | the clustered technologies that are attached to the    |
|         |   | key technology.                                        |
+---------+---+--------------------------------------------------------+
| NTCHTEG | I | The parameter NTCHTEG is only relevant when modeling   |
|         |   | clustered endogenous technology learning. If TEG is an |
| (r,p)   |   | ETL technology, then NTCHTEG(R,TEG) is the number of   |
|         |   | clustered technologies that are attached to key        |
|         |   | technology TEG. NTCHTEG is calculated in COEF_ETL.ETL  |
|         |   | from the "cluster mapping and coupling factor"         |
|         |   | (CLUSTER). It occurs in the special ETL cluster        |
|         |   | equation EQ_CLU.                                       |
+---------+---+--------------------------------------------------------+
| PBT     |   | The learning index PBT is an internal parameter        |
|         |   | calculated in COEF_ETL.ETL. It is derived from the     |
| (r,p)   |   | progress ratio PRAT using the formula: PBT(r,p) =      |
|         |   | -log(PRAT(r,p))/log(2). PBT does not occur directly in |
|         |   | the equations, but is used in the calculation of       |
|         |   | equation coefficients.                                 |
+---------+---+--------------------------------------------------------+
| PAT     |   | The internal parameter PAT describes the specific      |
|         |   | investment costs of the first unit. It is derived in   |
| (r,p)   |   | COEF_ETL.ETL using PBT, SC0 and CCAP0. PAT does not    |
|         |   | occur directly in the equations, but is used in the    |
|         |   | calculation of equation coefficients.                  |
+---------+---+--------------------------------------------------------+
| K       |   | The set K has the members '1'-'6' and is used as       |
|         |   | indicator for the kink points of the piecewise linear  |
|         |   | approximation of the cumulative cost curve. The number |
|         |   | of elements can be changed in the \*run file if        |
|         |   | desired.                                               |
+---------+---+--------------------------------------------------------+
| WEIG    | I | The internal parameter WEIG is calculated in           |
|         |   | COEF_ETL.ETL and is used as a factor in the            |
| (r      |   | calculation of the length of the intervals being used  |
| ,k,prc) |   | in the piecewise linear approximation of the           |
|         |   | cumulative cost curve. The interval lengths on the     |
|         |   | vertical axis are chosen in such a way that each       |
|         |   | interval is twice as wide as the preceding one.        |

####### Variables

The variables that are used to model the Endogenous Technological
Learning option in TIMES are presented in below. As is the case with the
modeling of lumpy investments, the primary role of the variables and
equations used to model ETL is to control the standard TIMES investment
variable (VAR_NCAP) and the associated dynamic cost of these
investments, so ETL is rather self-contained. That is the VAR_NCAP
variable links the ETL decisions to the rest of the model, and the
VAR_IC investment cost variable determines the associated contribution
to the regional investment costs (VAR_OBJINV). Note that the special
clustered learning ETL option does not require any additional variables,
as compared with the modeling of endogenous technology learning when
there are no clusters.

######## VAR_CCAP(r,t,p)

**Description:** The cumulative investment in capacity for an ETL
technology.

**Purpose and** This variable tracks the cumulative investment in
capacity for an ETL

**Occurrence:** technology which then determines, along with the
progress ratio, how much the investment cost is to be adjusted for the
learning gains.

This variable is generated for each ETL technology in all time periods
beginning from the period that the technology is first available. It
appears in the cumulative capacity definition constraint (EQ_CUINV) that
defines it as the initial cumulative capacity (CCAP0) plus investments
in new capacity (VAR_NCAP) made up to and including the current period.
It also appears in the cumulative capacity interpolation constraint
(EQ_CC). This constraint equates VAR_CCAP(r,t,p) to the sum over k of
the variables VAR_LAMBD(r,t,p,k) used to represent the cumulative
investment in capacity lying in the k^th^ interval of the piecewise
linear approximation of the cumulative cost curve.

**Units:** PJ/a, Gw, or Bvkm/a, or any other unit defined by the analyst
to represent technology capacity.

**Bounds:** This variable is not directly bounded. It may be indirectly
bounded by specifying a bound (NCAP_BND) on the level of investment in
new capacity (VAR_NCAP).

######## VAR_CCOST(r,t,p)

**Description:** The cumulative cost of investment in capacity for an
ETL technology.

**Purpose and** This variable defines the interpolated cumulative cost
of investment in

**Occurrence:** capacity in terms of the continuous variables VAR_LAMBD
and the binary variables VAR_DELTA, and the internal model parameters
ALPH and BETA. ALPH and BETA represent the intercepts on the vertical
axis and the slopes, respectively, of the line segments in the piecewise
linear approximation of the cumulative cost curve.

This variable is generated for each ETL technology in all time periods
beginning from the period that the technology is first available. It
appears in the cumulative cost interpolation equation (EQ_COS) that
defines it. It also appears in the equations EQ_IC1 and EQ_IC2 that
define the VAR_IC variables that represent the portions of the
cumulative cost of investment in capacity that are incurred in period t.

**Units:** Million 2000 US\$, or any other unit in which costs are
tracked.

**Bounds:** None.

######## VAR_DELTA(r,t,p,k)

**Description:** *Binary* variable (takes the value 0 or 1) used for an
ETL technology to indicate in which interval of the piecewise linear
approximation of the cumulative cost curve the cumulative investment in
capacity (VAR_CCAP) lies.

**Purpose and** To indicate which step on the learning curve a
technology achieves. A

**Occurrence:** value of 1 for this variable for interval k, and zero
values for intervals ≠ k, imply that the cumulative investment in
capacity (VAR_CCAP) lies in the k^th^ interval of the piecewise linear
approximation of the cumulative cost curve.

This binary variable, along with the associated continuous variable
VAR_LAMBD, are generated for each ETL technology in all time periods
beginning from the period that the technology is first available, and
for each interval in the piecewise linear approximation. It appears in
the constraint EQ_DEL, whose purpose is to ensure that, for each ETL
technology in each period, it has a value of 1 for exactly one interval
k (with zero values for intervals ≠ k); and in the cumulative cost
interpolation constraint (MR_COS). It also appears in the pair of
constraints EQ_LA1 and EQ_LA2, whose purpose is to ensure that
VAR_LAMBD, if positive for interval k, is between the two break points
on the horizontal axis for interval k in the piecewise linear
approximation. (See below under "Purpose and Occurrence" for the
variable VAR_LAMBD.)

Finally, this binary variable appears in two constraints EQ_EXPE1 and
EQ_EXPE2, whose purpose is to reduce the domain of feasibility of the
binary variables and thereby improve solution time for the Mixed Integer
Program (MIP).

**Units:** None. This is a binary variable that takes the value 0 or 1.

**Bounds:** This binary variable is not directly bounded.

########  VAR_IC(r,t,p)

**Description:** The portion of the cumulative cost of investment in
capacity for an ETL technology (VAR_CCOST) that is incurred in period t.

**Purpose and** This variable represents the portion of the cumulative
cost of investment

**Occurrence:** in capacity for an ETL technology that is incurred in
period t, and so is subject to the same discounting in the investment
cost part of the objective function (EQ_OBJINV) that applies to other
period t investment costs.

This variable is calculated as the difference between the cumulative
costs of investment in capacity for period t and t-1, and is generated
for each ETL technology in all time periods beginning from the period
that the technology is first available. Apart from its appearance in the
objective function, this variable appears in the constraints EQ_IC1 and
EQ_IC2 that define it in the first period that the technology is
available, and in subsequent periods, respectively. It also appears in
the salvage of investments constraint (EQ_OBJSALV), which calculates the
amount to be credited back to the objective function for learning
capacity remaining past the modeling horizon.

**Units:** Million 2000 US\$, or any other unit in which costs are
tracked.

**Bounds:** None.

######## VAR_LAMBD(r,t,p,k)

**Description:** *Continuous* variable used for an ETL technology to
represent the portion of cumulative investment in capacity (VAR_CCAP)
that lies in the k^th^ interval of the piecewise linear approximation of
the cumulative cost curve.

**Purpose and** A positive value for this variable for interval k, and
zero values for

**Occurrence:** intervals ≠ k, imply that the cumulative investment in
capacity (VAR_CCAP) lies in the k^th^ interval of the piecewise linear
approximation of the cumulative cost curve. This continuous variable,
along with the associated binary variable VAR_DELTA, are generated for
each ETL technology in all time periods beginning from the period that
the technology is first available (START), and for each interval in the
piecewise linear approximation.

> Since this variable represents the portion of the cumulative
> investment in capacity (VAR_CCAP) that lies in the k^th^ interval of
> the piecewise linear approximation of the cumulative cost curve, the
> value of EQ_LAMBD -- if positive -- is required to be between
> CCAPK(k-1,p) and CCAP(k,p), where the internal model parameters CCAPK
> are the break points on the horizontal axis in the piecewise linear
> approximation of the cumulative cost curve. A zero value for VAR_LAMBD
> is also allowed. These requirements on the value of VAR_LAMBD are
> imposed via the pair of constraints EQ_LA1 and EQ_LA2, in which the
> value for VAR_LAMBD is subject to lower and upper bounds of
> CCAPK(k-1,p) \* VAR_DELTA and CCAP(k,p) \* VAR_DELTA respectively,
> where VAR_DELTA = VAR_DELTA(r,t,p,k) is the binary variable associated
> with VAR_LAMBD = VAR_LAMBD(r,t,p,k).

This variable also appears in the cumulative capacity interpolation
constraint (EQ_CC), and the cumulative cost interpolation constraint
(EQ_COS).

**Units:** PJ/a, Gw, or Bvkm/a, or any other unit defined by the analyst
to represent technology capacity.

**Bounds:** The pair of constraints EQ_LA1 and EQ_LA2 that are discussed
above have the effect of either bounding VAR_LAMBD between CCAPK(k-1,p)
and CCAP(k,p), or forcing VAR_LAMBD to be zero.

####### Equations

The equations that are used to model the Endogenous Technological
Learning option in TIMES are presented in Table C-4 below. Since the
primary role of the variables and equations used to model ETL is to
control the standard TIMES investment variable (VAR_NCAP) and the
associated dynamic cost of these investments, ETL is rather
self-contained. That is the VAR_NCAP variable links the ETL decisions to
the rest of the model, and the VAR_IC investment cost variable
determines the associated contribution to the regional investment cost
part objective function (EQ_OBJINV). Note that the special clustered
learning ETL option involves one additional equation (EQ_CLU), as
compared with the modeling of endogenous technology learning where there
are no clusters. IN BOX BELOW, ADD ANSWER or CHANGE TO \"system\"

######## EQ_CC(r,t,p)

**Description:** The Cumulative Capacity Interpolation constraint for an
ETL technology.

**Purpose and** This constraint defines the cumulative investment in
capacity for a

**Occurrence:** technology in a period (VAR_CCAP) as the sum over all
intervals k of the *continuous* variables VAR_LAMBD(r,t,p,k) that
represent cumulative investment in capacity as lying in the k^th^
interval of the piecewise linear approximation of the cumulative cost
curve. This constraint links the cumulative capacity investment variable
(VAR_CCAP) to the variables VAR_LAMBD. In combination with other ETL
constraints, it is fundamental to ensuring the validity of the piecewise
linear approximation of the cumulative cost curve.

This equation is generated in each time period for which the ETL
technology is available.

**Units:** Technology capacity units.

**Type:** *Binding.* The equation is an equality (=) constraint.

**Interpretation of the results:**

*Primal:* The level of this constraint must be zero in a feasible
solution.

*Dual variable:* The dual variables of mixed integer problems have
limited usefulness, as discussed in Section 10.3 of PART I.

**Description:** For a [key]{.underline} learning ETL technology it
defines investment in new capacity (VAR_NCAP) as the weighted sum of
investments in new capacity of the attached clustered technologies. The
weights used are the numeric values of the CLUSTER parameter.

**Purpose and** Defines the relationship between investment in new
capacity for a [key]{.underline}

**Occurrence:** learning ETL technology and investment in new capacity
for the associated clustered technologies. This equation is generated in
each time period for which the ETL technology is available. It is a
[key]{.underline} learning technology, that is, it has associated
clustered technologies.

**Units:** Money units, e.g., million 2000 US\$, or any other unit in
which costs are tracked.

**Type:** *Binding.* The equation is an equality (=) constraint.

**Interpretation of the results:**

*Primal:* The level of this constraint must be zero in a feasible
solution.

*Dual variable:* The dual variable (DVR_CLU) of this constraint in the
MIP solution is of little interest.

**Remarks:** Activation of the special [clustered]{.underline} learning
ETL option occurs automatically if data is included for the CLUSTER
parameter.

###### TIMES Demand Functions

####### Introduction

As discussed in Chapters 3 and 4 of Part I, in TIMES the standard Demand
Function formulation includes only sensitive of the demands to their own
prices, modeled through a linearized formulation of the price
elasticities. Until TIMES v4.0, only the linearized own-price elasticity
formulation was available in the common code. In MARKAL, the
corresponding non-linear formulation was also available (see Loulou &
al. 2004), and it was therefore subsequently made available in TIMES
v4.1 and above, as the first natural generalization of the original
demand functions.

When substitution possibilities are to be modeled, demand functions
involving Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) aggregates are very
commonly used in economic models integrating engineering and
bio-physical properties. Hence, the possibility to use CES-based demand
functions were considered desirable also in TIMES. The non-linear option
implemented for modeling CES aggregates is based on the old sketches
that were found in the MARKAL GAMS code (but were not active in the
code), designed by Dr. Denise Van Regemorter and implemented by Gary
Goldstein. Just like under the own-price elasticity option, the
calibration of the CES functions is based on the demand projections and
the corresponding shadow prices from the solution of a Baseline TIMES
run. When defining CES functions, the substitution elasticity between
the demands within each CES aggregate is given as an input. The
aggregate outputs of the CES functions may then be considered as the
final useful demands, with the standard exogenous Baseline projections
and own-price elasticities provided for the aggregate demands.

A linearization of the CES demand function formulation has also been
implemented, and is available in three different variants. In the
lienearized formulation, the CES demand functions can be also
subsequently nested further into higher-level CES functions.

All the generalizations presented in this Appendix have been implemented
in TIMES v4.1.0. For now, the implementation should be still considered
experimental, and therefore any feedback, comments and suggestions from
TIMES users concerning the formulation and implementation are welcome.

In this Appendix we provide the input attributes and modeling details
associated with the generalized Demand Functions in TIMES. As mentioned
above, the implementation of the Demand Functions in TIMES is based on
the corresponding formulations originally designed for the MARKAL model
generator. The next three sections of the Appendix will address the
Sets, Parameters, Variables, and Equations related to the Demand
Function options, including the special volume-preserving CES option
where the aggre­gate volume of the components of the combined demand
remains equal to the (optionally weighted) sum of the component demands
also under any substitution taking place.

####### Mathematical formulation

For the own-price elasticities, we have the following relations (see
Part I, Chapter 4), where *U~i~* is the term in the objective function
associated with the utility change due to the demand variation of demand
*i*:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image489.wmf)                                            \(1\)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------ -------
  ![](media/image490.wmf)                                            \(2\)

  ![](media/image491.wmf)                                            \(3\)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider then a utility function of the general CES form:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image492.wmf)                                            \(4\)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------ -------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

where:

-   *U~k~* is the total aggregate utility of demand *k*

-   *x~i~* is the demand for commodity *i* (component of the aggregate
    demand)

-   *α~i~* is a share parameter (the sum of which over *i* needs not be
    equal to 1)

-   *σ* is the elasticity of substitution (0 \< *σ* \< ∞)

The demand functions for *x~i~* can be derived from the utility function
in terms of prices, and can be given by the formulas:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image493.wmf)                                            \(5\)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------ -------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

where *m* is the income level, and *p~u~* is the aggregate price, or
unit cost, of the utility, can be given in terms of the individual
prices *p~i~* of the demands *i*:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image494.wmf)                                            \(6\)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------ -------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The share parameters *α~i~* can be derived from the expenditure shares,
as shown in Eq. (7) below. In the objective function, the utility change
can then be calculated by the expression shown in Eq. (9) below.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image495.wmf)                                            \(7\)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------ -------
  ![](media/image496.wmf)                                            \(8\)

  ![](media/image497.wmf)                                            \(9\)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above, the coefficients *agg~i~* are represent user-defined
aggregation coefficients for defining the aggregation from the component
demands to the aggregate demands. The constant term corresponding to the
Baseline value is subtracted in order to reproduce the value of the
Baseline objective function when no variation occurs from the Baseline
demands. The non-linear formulation of the elastic demand functions
implemented in TIMES follows these expressions.

The corresponding linearized formulations are based on piece-wise linear
functions which approximate the integrals over the inverse demand
curves, as explained in Part I, Chapter 4. The method described there
has been generalized to linearize also the somewhat more complex CES
demand functions, allowing also for nested CES functions. Each demand
having own-price or substitution elasticities requires the definition of
as many variables as there are steps in the discrete representation of
the demand curve (both upward and downward), for each period and region.
Each such variable has an upper bound, and in the CES formulation they
are included in an additional balance equation. However, otherwise the
step variables are not involved in other new constraints. Therefore, the
linear program is augmented by a number of variables, but does not have
any notable number of more constraints than the initial inelastic LP.
For partial equilibrium models, volume-preserving demand functions may,
however, be preferred over standard CES formulations, and therefore an
option for using a simple volume-preserving variant of the CES
linearization has been also implemented.

The resulting linearization has been verified to work well over a large
range of demand elasticities and price changes, and indeed also with
nested CES functions. Cobb-Douglas functions (*σ* = 1) are also
supported. Using the same linearization approach, even the simple Macro
general equilibrium model, which is integrated in TIMES-Macro and
includes Cobb-Douglas function nested into a CES production function,
might be in principle linearized into an LP problem.

It is also important to note again here that, instead of maximizing the
net total surplus, TIMES minimizes its negative (plus a constant). For
this and other reasons, it is inappropriate to pay too much attention to
the meaning of the *absolute* objective function values. Rather,
examining the difference between the objective function values of two
scenarios is a far more useful exercise. That difference is of course,
the negative of the difference between the net total surpluses of the
two scenario runs.

+---------+--------+---------------------------------------------------+

**Important remarks:**

-   *COM_PROJ* should be explicitly defined by the user only for the
    component demands, and never for the aggregate demands.

-   As mentioned in Table D-2, the substitution elasticities can be
    defined by specifying *COM_ELAST*(r,t,com,ANNUAL,\'N\') for the
    aggregate demands. However, \'FX\' elasticities for the *component
    demands* can be optionally specified for defining
    component-differentiated substitution elasticities. Nonetheless,
    even when doing so, *COM_ELAST*(r,t,com, ANNUAL,\'N\') always
    defines the minimum substitution elasticity among the component
    demands of ***com***.

-   Note that the aggregate demands are always at the ANNUAL level only,
    and thus only ANNUAL level own-price demand elasticities are
    supported for the demand aggregates.

-   When using the non-linear formulation, demand substitution is
    supported only at the ANNUAL level for the component demands of the
    CES aggregates. The demand variations will thus be proportionally
    the same for all timeslices.

-   Multi-level nested CES demand aggregations are also fully supported
    both in the non-linear and in the linearized case.

-   Recursive CES demand aggregations are not supported, neither in the
    non-linear nor in the linearized case.

-   The Cobb-Douglas case (*σ~k~*=1) is also supported, but in the
    non-linear formulation it is handled by setting *σ~k~* very close to
    unity.

####### Examples

Assume that we wish to define a non-linear CES demand function for the
aggregate demand TLPKM (passenger land travel), having the following
component demands:

-   TRT -- passenger car travel

-   TRB -- passenger bus travel

-   TRW -- passenger two-wheeler travel

-   TTP -- passenger rail travel

The demand function can be set up with the following input parameters
(where **r** stands for regions, **t** for milestone years, and
\'**0**\' for interpolation option placeholder):

######## VAR_COMPRD(r,t,c,s)

**Description:** The amount of demand commodity **c** procured at time
period **t**, timeslice **s**.

**Purpose and** This variable tracks the total amount of demand
commodity produced.

**Occurrence:** This variable is normally only created if a bound is
imposed on total production of the demand commodity, or a cost is
explicitly associated with the production level of the demand. However,
when defining CES demand functions, the variable is always created both
for the component demand and for the aggregate demand. The variable is
defined through the equations EQE_COMPRD and/or EQ(l)\_COMBAL.

**Units:** PJ, Bvkm, or any other unit defined by the analyst to
represent the quantity of the demand.

**Bounds:** This variable is non-negative. It is by default not
otherwise directly bounded. It can be directly bounded by the COM_BNDPRD
attribute. It may be indirectly bounded by specifying a user constraint
referring to it by UC_COMPRD.

######## VAR_DEM

**Description:** The total amount of demand for commodity **c** in time
period **t**.

**Purpose:** This variable is used for tracking the endogenous amount of
demand for commodity **c** in the non-linear formulation of elastic
demands.

**Occurrence:** This variable is not created in the LP formulation. It
is only created in the non-linear formulation of demand functions based
on own-price and/or substitution elasticities (as well as in the Macro
formulation). It is generated for each demand with a non-linear
own-price elasticity function, and for all demands associated with a
non-linear CES demand function.

**Units:** PJ, Bvkm, or any other unit in which demands are tracked.

**Bounds:** This variable is non-negative and is not bounded upwards.

######## VAR_ELAST (r,t,c,s,j,bd)

**Description:** Variables used to linearize elastic demand curves by
step-wise variations.

**Purpose:** To indicate how far the demand variation extends on the
elasticity curve, by step.

**Occurrence:** Each elastic demand is expressed as the sum of these
variables. In the objective function, these variables are used to bear
the cost of demand losses and revenues of demand gains as explained in
Part I, Chapter 4.

These variables are defined whenever a demand is declared to be price
elastic, either to its own price or through cross-elastic substitution.
These variables are indexed by j, where j runs over the number of steps
used for discretizing the demand curve of demand commodity c. The jth
variable stands for the portion of the demand that lies within
discretization interval **j**, on side **bd** (**bd** indicates either
increase or decrease of demand w.r.t. the reference case demand). In the
objective function, these variables are used to represent the utility
change caused by demand losses or gains, as explained in Part I, Chapter
4.

**Units:** Demand units: PJ, Bvkm, or any other unit in which the demand
is tracked.

**Bounds:** This variable is non-negative. Each ELAST variable is
bounded upward via virtual equation EQ_BNDELAS, of in the case of a CES
function, via the equation EQL_COMCES.

######## VAR_OBJELS (r,bd,cur)

**Description:** Variables used to linearize elastic demand curves by
step-wise variations.

**Purpose:** To indicate how far the demand variation extends on the
elasticity curve.

**Occurrence:** The utility change caused by all demand losses and gains
as explained in Part I, Chapter 4.

These variables are defined whenever any of the elastic demand
formulations is used. These variables are indexed by **bd** (**bd**
indicates either increase or decrease of demand w.r.t. the reference
case demand). These variables are included in the objective function, to
represent the total utility changes caused by demand losses or gains, as
explained in Part I, Chapter 4.

**Units:** Demand units: PJ, Bvkm, or any other unit in which the demand
is tracked.

**Bounds:** This variable is non-negative.

####### Equations

The equations that are used to model the demand functions in TIMES are
presented in Table D-6 below. The primary role of the variables and
equations used to model Demand Functions is to control the standard
TIMES demand variables VAR_DEM and the associated losses or gains in
consumer\'s utility in the regional demand utility part of the objective
function (EQ_OBJELS).

    Raman, GAMS Development Corporation, December 1998.

[^2]: The meaning and the role of internal and external regions is
    discussed in Section 2.2.

[^3]: See Section for a more in-depth treatment of commodity groups.

[^4]: This column contains the names of the indexes as used in this
    document.

[^5]: For programming reasons, alternative names (aliases) may exist for
    some indexes. This information is only relevant for those users who
    are interested in gaining an understanding of the underlying GAMS
    code.

[^6]: This column refers to possible related indexes, e.g. the index set
    **c** is a subset of the index set **cg**.

[^7]: VEDA/ANSWER compiles the complete list from the union of the
    commodities defined in each region.

[^8]: VEDA/ANSWER compiles the complete list from the union of the
    commodity groups defined in each region.

[^9]: VEDA/ANSWER compiles the complete list from the union of processes
    defined in each region.

[^10]: Important cases are the process type CHP, which activates the CHP
    attributes, storage process indicators (STG, STS, STK, NST), and
    material conversion process types PRW and PRV, which may affect the
    creation of the internal set **prc_spg** (see ).

[^11]: In this case the model may still decide to add additional new
    capacity, if this is economical and not inhibited by any investment
    bounds.

[^12]: The purpose of this table is to list those parameters whose year
    values are independent of the input **datayear**s associated with
    most of the regular parameters, and therefore need not be included
    in the set **datayear**. For example, a value for MULTI(j,\'2012\')
    would not require including 2012 in **datayear**s if 2012 were not
    relevant to the other input parameters.

[^13]: By setting G_YRFR(r,s)=0 one can exclude any individual
    timeslices from specific regions, even if only a global timeslice
    tree is defined for all regions (as it is the case when using
    VEDA-FE). In this way each region can employ a different subset of
    the global tree.

[^14]: Note however that some flexibility is lost when using
    multilateral trade. For instance, it is not possible to express
    transportation costs in a fully accurate manner, if such cost
    depends upon the precise pair of trading regions in a specific way.

[^15]: The first row contains the set name. If the set is a
    one-dimensional subset of another set, the second row contains the
    parent set in brackets. If the set is a multi-dimensional set, the
    second row contains the index domain in brackets.

[^16]: For programming reasons, alternative names (aliases) may exist
    for some indexes. This information is only relevant for those users
    who are interested in gaining an understanding of the underlying
    GAMS code.

[^17]: For multidimensional sets such as this one, two definitions are
    sometimes given, one as an indicator function or mapping, the other
    (in square brackets) as a set of n-tuples.

[^18]: Name of the internal set as used in this documentation and the
    GAMS code.

[^19]:
    > Index domain of the internal set is given in brackets (Note: the
    > symbols **y**, **y1**, **y2**, **k**, and **ll** all refer to
    > **year**).

[^20]:
    > The asterisk denotes in the modeling system GAMS a wildcard, so
    > that domain checking is disabled and any index may be used.

[^21]: The term *target timeslice level* or *target timeslice* is used
    in the following as synonym for the timeslice level or timeslices
    which are required by the model generators depending on the process
    or commodity timeslice resolution (**prc_tsl** and **com_tsl**
    respectively).

[^22]: Note that as an exception, for NCAP_AF direct inheritance and
    aggregation will be disabled if any values are specified at the
    process timeslice level. However, this may be circumvented by using
    NCAP_AFS for defining the values at process timeslices.

[^23]: The first row contains the parameter name, the second row
    contains in brackets the index domain over which the parameter is
    defined.

[^24]: This column gives references to related input parameters (in
    upper case) or sets (in lower case) being used in the context of
    this parameter as well as internal parameters/sets or result
    parameters being derived from the input parameter.

[^25]: This column lists the unit of the parameter, the possible range
    of its numeric value \[in square brackets\] and the
    inter-/extrapolation rules that apply.

[^26]: An indication of circumstances for which the parameter is to be
    provided or omitted, as well as description of
    inheritance/aggregation rules applied to parameters having the
    timeslice (**s)** index.

[^27]: Equations or variables that are directly affected by the
    parameter.

[^28]: Abbreviation i/e = inter-/extrapolation

[^29]: Standard aggregation not implemented for FLO_BND.

[^30]: The indexing of auxiliary consumption flows or emissions of
    inter-regional exchange processes is illustrated in the figure
    below.

    ![](media/image12.emf)

[^31]: The first row contains the parameter name, the second row
    contains in brackets the index domain, for which the parameter is
    defined.

[^32]: GDX stands for GAMS Data Exchange. A GDX file is a binary file
    that stores the values of one or more GAMS symbols such as sets,
    parameters variables and equations. GDX files can be used to prepare
    data for a GAMS model, present results of a GAMS model, store
    results of the same model using different parameters etc. They do
    not store a model formulation or executable statements.

[^33]: The use of the **gdx2veda** tool together with the
    **times2veda.vdd** control file and the **VEDA-BE** software are
    described in Part V.

[^34]: First row: parameter name; second row (in brackets): the index
    domain, for which the parameter is defined.

[^35]: The activity remains constant over the iso-fuel line, but the
    electricity output varies when moving along it. Maximum electrical
    output is thus usually the most convenient quantity along this line
    for defining the basis of the process activity and capacity. This
    choice should then be consistently reflected in the input data (see
    ).

[^36]: The indexing of auxiliary consumption flows or emissions of
    inter-regional exchange processes is illustrated in the figure
    below.

    ![](media/image12.emf)

[^37]: The equation EQ(l)\_XBND may have an external regional as region
    index (bounding the import from one external regions to all other
    regions).

[^38]: In case the dollar control parameter VAR_UC is set to YES, the
    user constraints are always strict equalities (***l***=E) with the
    RHS constants replaced by the user constraint variables given in the
    table. The RHS bound parameter (UC_RHS(R)(T)(S)) are then applied to
    these user constraint related variables. See Section 5.20.

[^39]: The actual implementation of OBJ in the GAMS program is different
    from the one described in the documentation, since the annualizing
    of the various cost components is not performed in the GAMS code of
    the OBJ equation, but rather in the reporting section of the
    program, for improved code performance. However, despite the
    simplification, the GAMS code results in an objective function that
    is fully equivalent to the one in this documentation.

[^40]: This is the default definition adopted for *CRF*, corresponding
    to beginning-of-year discounting. For other discounting options, see
    Section .

[^41]: Ideally, it would be desirable that cases 1 be used only for
    those investments that have no lead time (and thus no interest
    during construction). However, if cases 1 are employed even for
    projects with significant IDC's, these should have their IDC
    included in the investment cost.

[^42]: Parameters that occur in the ETL-specific equations but that also
    occur in non-ETL equations (e.g., TCH_LIFE) are not listed in this
    table.

[^43]: GAMS moves all constants (e.g. past investments) on the RHS and
    the variables on the LHS of the equation. In the listing file the
    primal value of the equation can be found in the solution report
    under the LEVEL column. The RHS value is given under the column
    UPPER column in case of a \<= inequality and in the LOWER column for
    a \>= inequality. For an equality LOWER, LEVEL and UPPER value are
    the same.

[^44]: The primal value and the RHS constant of an equation can be found
    in the GAMS listing file in solution report part. The LEVEL value
    column corresponds to the primal value, the LOWER level value equals
    the RHS of a constraint of type \>= and the UPPER level value equals
    the RHS of a constraint of a type \<=.

[^45]: If the coefficient UC_ACT, UC_FLO, etc. is greater than one, it
    represents an annual growth rate, while a coefficient smaller than
    one describes an annual decay rate.

[^46]: There exists another well-known representation of CO~2~
    accumulation equations, using a five-box model.

[^47]: Note that the subscripts *atm* and *up*, which for the CO2
    equations referred to the atmosphere and upper reservoirs, have been
    reused for the CH4 and N2O equations to stand for anthropogenic and
    natural concentrations.

[^48]: The first row contains the parameter name, the second row
    contains in brackets the index domain over which the parameter is
    defined.

[^49]: This column gives references to related input parameters or sets
    being used in the context of this parameter as well as internal
    parameters/sets or result parameters being derived from the input
    parameter.

[^50]: This column lists the unit of the parameter, the possible range
    of its numeric value \[in square brackets\] and the
    inter-/extrapolation rules that apply.

[^51]: An indication of circumstances for which the parameter is to be
    provided or omitted.

[^52]: Equations or variables that are directly affected by the
    parameter.

[^53]: Abbreviation i/e = inter-/extrapolation
