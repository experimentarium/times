# Equations

The equations that are used to model the Endogenous Technological Learning option in TIMES are presented in {numref}`etl-constraints` below. Since the primary role of the variables and equations used to model ETL is to control the standard TIMES investment variable (VAR_NCAP) and the associated dynamic cost of these investments, ETL is rather self-contained. That is the VAR_NCAP variable links the ETL decisions to the rest of the model, and the VAR_IC investment cost variable determines the associated contribution to the regional investment cost part objective function (EQ_OBJINV). Note that the special clustered learning ETL option involves one additional equation (EQ_CLU), as compared with the modeling of endogenous technology learning where there are no clusters.

**Description:** One of two constraints for an ETL technology to improve MIP solution time by reducing the domain of feasibility of the binary variables VAR_DELTA.

**Purpose and Occurrence:** To improve MIP solution time this constraint takes advantage of the observation that cumulative investment is increasing with time, thus ensuring that if the cumulative investment in period t lies in segment $k$, then it will not lie in segments $k-1, k-2, ..., 1$ in period $t+1$. This equation is generated for each ETL technology in each time period, for which the technology is available, and excluding the final period (TLAST), and for each interval k in the piecewise linear approximation of the cumulative cost curve.

## EQ_IC1(r,t,p)

**Description:** The constraint for an ETL technology that defines the portion of the cumulative cost of investment in capacity (VAR_IC) that is incurred in period $t$, where $t$ is the first period of model horizon.

**Purpose and Occurrence:** To determine the variable VAR_IC which represents the current investment cost incurred in the first period a learning technology is available according to the cumulative investments made in that period. VAR_IC then enters the regional investment cost part of the objective function (EQ_OBJINV) subject to the same discounting that applies to other period $t$ investment costs. This equation is generated for the first period of the model horizon.

**Units:** Money units, e.g., million 2000 US\$, or any other unit in which costs are tracked.

If binary variable VAR_DELTA = 1, the effect is to set a lower bound on variable VAR_LAMBD(r,t,p,k) of CCAPK(r,k-1,p), whereas if VAR_DELTA = 0 the effect is to set a lower bound of 0. This constraint, in combination with other ETL constraints, is fundamental to ensuring the validity of the piecewise linear approximation of the cumulative cost curve.

This equation is generated in each time period, for which the ETL technology is available, and for each interval k in the piecewise linear approximation of the cumulative cost curve.

**Units:** Technology capacity units.

**Purpose and Occurrence:** To set the upper bound of VAR_LAMBD(r,t,p,k) to CCAPK(r,k,p) \* VAR_DELTA, where CCAPK(r,k,p) is the right hand end of the $k^{th}$ interval and VAR_DELTA = VAR_DELTA(r,t,p,k) is the binary variable associated with VAR_LAMBD(r,t,p,k). If binary variable VAR_DELTA = 1, the effect is to set an upper bound on variable VAR_LAMBD(r,t,p,k) of CCAPK(r,k,p), whereas if VAR_DELTA = 0 the effect is to set an upper bound of 0. This constraint, in combination with other ETL constraints, is fundamental to ensuring the validity of the piecewise linear approximation of the cumulative cost curve.
